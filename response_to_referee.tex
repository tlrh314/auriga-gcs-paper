\section*{Introduction (of referee report)}
``The results of the paper clearly demonstrate that the technique of simulating
stellar clusters in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations by tagging stellar
particles based on their ages does not reproduce key properties of observed GC 
systems in the Milky Way and M31. However, the authors do not state this conclusion
anywhere''.

We feel that our conclusion would be too strongly phrased if we would generalise 
our results obtained using the Auriga simulations to cosmological simulations 
in general. Indeed, we do find that age-selected stellar particles do not 
reproduce key properties of observed GC systems in the Milky Way and M31. However,
our results might reflect characteristics that are specific to Auriga, 
e.g. that the galaxy formation model overmixes metals at early times. 
Therefore we did add a final bulletpoint to our conclusion to clarify the above, 
but we limit the scope to the Auriga simulations.

\item I replaced `Sec.' by `Section' to refer to sections in the present work.
Moreover, I changed `Sec.' to `section' to refer to a section in one of the references.
\item All acronyms are introduced the first time they appear in the text
(MW, M31, GC, GCS, YMC, ISM, SN, AGB, DM, and Au). The subset thereof that appears 
in the abstract is also introduced the first time it appears.

    added `star formation'.
