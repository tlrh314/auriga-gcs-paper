\section{Introduction}
Globular \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{star }\DIFaddend clusters (GC)s are old, bright, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ubiquitous, and various }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and ubiquitous. Various }\DIFaddend properties of
GC systems \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(GCS) }\DIFaddend show correlations with their host galaxies. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{GC systems }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GCSs }\DIFaddend are believed to
retain information about the galactic (gas) conditions at \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{their }\DIFaddend times of formation\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{,
thus, could offer }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.
Thus they could offer a }\DIFaddend unique insight into the (chemodynamical) evolution of their 
parent galaxies, if the formation and evolution of GCs- and GC systems themselves 
is adequately understood. However, despite decades of research (the extensive 
literature on GCs is summarised in several books and review articles, e.g.~\citealt{
1991ARA&A..29..543H, Harris2001, 2004Natur.427...31W, 2006ARA&A..44..193B, 
2012A&ARv..20...50G, 2014CQGra..31x4006K, 2018RSPSA.47470616F}), consensus on an 
exhaustive picture of the formation of GCs is yet to be reached.

The literature offers a wealth of formation scenarios. \citet{1968ApJ...154..891P}
and \citet{1984ApJ...277..470P} argue that GCs form as the earliest bound
structures in the Universe (i.e. prior to formation of the main galaxy), 
noting that the Jeans length and mass shortly after recombination is consistent
with typical GC masses and sizes. \citet{2005MNRAS.364..367D} and \citet{
2009ApJ...706L.192B} argue that (the blue subpopulations of) GCs form in \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{radially
}\DIFaddend biased dark matter halos at high redshift. Other recent hypotheses of GC formation 
prior to collapse of the proto-galaxy include formation in colliding supershells 
\citep{2017Ap&SS.362..183R}, in supersonically induced gaseous objects
\citep{2019arXiv190408941C}, or in high-speed collisions of dark matter subhaloes
\citep{2019arXiv190508951M}. \citet{2017MNRAS.472.3120B} suggests
that (the blue subpopulation of) GCs could form in high density regions along
the cosmic filament before or during collapse.

Other models also date GCs formation during formation of the proto-galaxy itself,
for example as a result of thermal instabilities in hot gas-rich haloes 
(\citealt{1985ApJ...298...18F}, also see the discussions in \citealt{
1990ApJ...363..488K}). Alternative formation \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{trigggers }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{triggers }\DIFaddend are also explored, such as 
(other causes of) shock compression, or cloud-cloud colissions \citep[e.g.][]{
1980glcl.conf..301G, 1992ApJ...400..265M, 1994ApJ...429..177H, 1995ApJ...442..618V,
1996ASPC...92..241L, 2001ApJ...560..592C}. 

Yet another hypothesis is that star cluster formation is triggered by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(major 
) 
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{major 
}\DIFaddend gas-rich (spiral) galaxy mergers \citep{1987nngp.proc...18S, 1992ApJ...384...50A},
which is naturally expected within the framework of hierarchical assembly. One
testable prediction of this scenario is the formation of young clusters in
interacting and merging galaxies, which has been observed and are found to show 
remarkable similarities with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{globulars in the Milky Way }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GCs in the MW }\DIFaddend \citep[e.g.][]{
1995AJ....109..960W, 1996AJ....112..416H, 1999AJ....118..752Z, 1999AJ....118.1551W}.
Moreover, modelling efforts of this framework yield GC (sub)populations consistent 
with various observables \citep[e.g.][]{2010ApJ...718.1266M, 2018MNRAS.480.2343C}, 
and the recent numerical simulation of an isolated dwarf-dwarf merger executed at 
very high resolution (baryonic mass $m_b \sim$~4M\Sun; softening $\epsilon = 0.1$\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{) 
produce }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~pc) 
produces }\DIFaddend star clusters that could be \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{globular }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GC }\DIFaddend progenitors \citep{
2019arXiv190509840L}.

As for the formation timeline, the scenarios (and flavours thereof) of \citet{
1985ApJ...298...18F} and \citet{1992ApJ...384...50A} are intertwined because
accretion and mergers continuously occurs \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{trough out }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{during the }\DIFaddend hierarchical build-up of
galaxies. Various (other) hierarchical formation channels thus combine different
aspects of the aforementioned paradigms, such as GC formation in (small) galactic
disks before they are accreted onto an assembling galaxy \citep[e.g.][]{
2000ApJ...533..869C, 2002ApJ...567..853C, 2002MNRAS.333..383B, 2003egcs.conf..224G}. 
We refer to \citet{2001astro.ph..8034G} for a scoreboard of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the aforementioned 
paradigms }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GC formation models 
}\DIFaddend compared to observations of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Milky Way globular cluster system}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{MW GCSs}\DIFaddend .

An idea that has recently been studied \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in detail }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{extensively }\DIFaddend is the hypothesis that the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{physical 
processes responsible for the formation
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{formation
mechanisms }\DIFaddend of young massive clusters \citep[YMCs, see][for a review]{2010ARA&A..48..431P} 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, as observable in detail }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and GCs are the same. The proximity of YMCs }\DIFaddend in the local Universe \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in great
, also governs GC formation }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{allows to study these 
processes with a level of detail that cannot be achieved for GCs }\DIFaddend at high redshifts. In 
this framework, differences between both classes of objects are caused by nearly a 
Hubble time of (dynamical) evolution \citep[e.g.][]{1987degc.book.....S}. This picture 
is based on observed similarities between YMCs and GCs
\citep[e.g.][]{1992AJ....103..691H,1999AJ....118.1551W} and strengthened by observations
of gravitationally lensed objects at high redshifts ($z = 2-6)$. These sources have 
properties reminiscent of (local) YMCs and may be GC progenitors at times of formation 
\citep{2017MNRAS.467.4304V,2017ApJ...843L..21J}. The modelling work by 
\citet{2011MNRAS.414.1339K,2012MNRAS.421.1927K,2015MNRAS.454.1658K} is now 
incorporated into cosmological zoom simulations and shows promising results
\citep{2018MNRAS.475.4309P,2019MNRAS.486.3134K}.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Simulation resolutions have }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The (mass) resolution of cosmological zoom simulations has }\DIFaddend reached the mass range 
populated by GCs, and the gravitational force softening can be as low several 
parsec. A number of groups can thus incorporate formation of (globular) star 
clusters into their high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations. \citet{2016ApJ...831..204R} 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{run }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ran }\DIFaddend parsec scale simulations of the high-redshift universe 
prior to reionization (the simulations stop at $z=9$), \citet{2017ApJ...834...69L} 
implement a new subgrid model for star (cluster) formation and run simulations 
that reach $z=3.3$, and the run of \citet{2017MNRAS.465.3622R} reaches $z=0.5$. 
\citet{2018MNRAS.474.4232K} find that mergers can push gas to high density that
quickly forms clustered stars that end up tightly bound by the end of the 
simulation. A somewhat different approach couples semi-analytical models to DM-only
simulations \citep{2010ApJ...718.1266M,2014ApJ...796...10L,2018MNRAS.480.2343C,
2019MNRAS.486..331C,2019arXiv190505199C}, as is done in the work by 
\citet{2019MNRAS.482.4528E}.

In this work we use state of the art simulations that produce realistic spiral 
galaxies \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(MW analogues) }\DIFaddend at redshift zero for which several global properties 
are consistent with the observations. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{simulations yield realistic Milky Way analogues, and real
galaxies host globular cluster systems. The }\DIFdelend question thus naturally arises whether 
the star formation histories of the simulations \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(also) }\DIFdelend give rise to a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{GC system 
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GCS }\DIFaddend similar to 
the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Milky Way }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{MW }\DIFaddend and/or \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Andromeda globular cluster systems}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{M31 GCSs}\DIFaddend . In particular, 
we use the Auriga \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{suite of cosmological zoom simulations (\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citealt{2017MNRAS.467..179G}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, 
and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{simulations \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[][hereafter G17]{2017MNRAS.467..179G}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, 
further }\DIFaddend described in Sec.~\ref{sec:auriga}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{) to
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. We }\DIFaddend investigate whether the star 
formation model implemented produces metallicity, 
radial, and metallicity-radial distributions that are consistent with the MW 
and/or M31 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{GC systems}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GCSs}\DIFaddend , and whether the model produces enough stellar mass with
the right properties to allow for formation efficiencies lower than unity and
the expected (dynamical) mass loss over the cluster lifetime (not modelled 
explicitly in this study). 

The plan of the paper is as follows. We summarise the relevant characteristics 
of the Auriga simulations in section~\ref{sec:auriga}, followed by a summary of 
the observations of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Milky Way (MW ) and Andromeda globular cluster system (GCS)
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{MW and M31 GCSs
}\DIFaddend in section~\ref{sec:observations} that we use to compare our simulations to in
section~\ref{sec:results}. We discuss our findings in section~\ref{sec:discussion}
to come to our conclusions in section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.

characteristic peak mass of the lognormal GC mass distribution of $10^{5}$~M\Sun 
\citep{1991ARA&A..29..543H}, although the gravitational softening is two orders 
of magnitudes larger than typical GC radii \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of several parsec}\DIFaddend . High-density gaseous 
regions are thus not expected to produce surviving stellar clumps with masses and 
radii consistent with GCs because such objects would numerically disperse, even 
in the highest-resolution runs. On the other hand, we can investigate (statistical) 
properties of age-selected GC candidates because each star particle represents a
single stellar population with a total mass that could be consistent with one \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{globular cluster}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GC}\DIFaddend . 
This means that their formation sites and that of a real-world GC may be consistent.

\section{Observational data}
\label{sec:observations}
We describe the observations of the MW GCS in Sec.~\ref{sec:milkyway},
and of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Andromeda (}\DIFdelend M31 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{) }\DIFdelend GCS in Sec.~\ref{sec:andromeda}


\subsection{Milky Way}
\label{sec:milkyway}
\citet[][2010 edition; hereafter H96e10]{1996AJ....112.1487H} provides a
catalogue\footnote{See \url{https://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/Fac_Harris/mwgc.dat}}
of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Milky Way globular cluster system }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{MW GCS }\DIFaddend that contains properties of 157 GCs. 
The authors initially estimated the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{size of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{number of GCs in }\DIFaddend the MW GCS to be 180~$\pm$~10,
thus, their catalogue to be ${\sim}$85\% complete. However, an additional 59 GCs
are claimed to have been discovered by various authors. The total number of GCs
in the MW might add up to 216 with recent estimates now anticipating an additional 
thirty GCs yet to be discovered \citep[e.g.][and references therein]{2018ApJ...863L..38R}.
We still use data from the Harris catalogue, but caution that it may (only) be
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{53-72}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{50-70}\DIFaddend \% complete. Specifically, the relevant data fields that we use from H96e10
are the metallicity [Fe/H], the Galactic distance components $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ (in
kpc)\footnote{In a Sun-centered coordinate system: $X$ points toward Galactic
center, $Y$ in direction of Galactic rotation, and $Z$ toward the North Galactic
Pole. We calculate the galactocentric radius \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$R_{\text{GC}}=\sqrt{(X-R_\odot)^2
+ Y^2 + Z^2}$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$R_{\text{gal}}=\sqrt{(X-R_\odot)^2
+ Y^2 + Z^2}$}\DIFaddend , assuming the solar radius $R_\odot=8$~kpc.}, and absolute
magnitude in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{V-band }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{V~band, }\DIFaddend $M_V$. We use the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{latter }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{V~band magnitude }\DIFaddend to calculate 
mass-estimates by assuming $M_{V,\odot}=4.83$ and a mass to light ratio 
$M/L_V = 1.7$~M/L$_{\odot}$, the mean for MW clusters \citep{2005ApJS..161..304M}. 
We supplement the catalogue with age-estimates from isochrone fits to stars near 
the main-sequence turnoff in 55 GCs \citep[][hereafter V13]{2013ApJ...775..134V}.

% \citet{2019AJ....157...12B} communicate the latest efforts to aggregate the

%DIF >  and alike objects in the MW, the catalog contains 200 GCs and 94 GC
% candidates. The CatClu catalog contains reference papers, positions, distances,
% and total absolute V magnitude. Therefore we rely on the H96e10 dataset.

\subsection{Andromeda}
\label{sec:andromeda}
The fifth revision of the revised \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{bologna }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Bologna }\DIFaddend catalogue (RBC~5, last updated
August, 2012) is the latest edition of three decades of systematically
collecting integrated properties of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{globular cluster system of the
Andromeda galaxy }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GCS of M31 }\DIFaddend \citep[][and references therein]{2004A&A...416..917G}. One
contribution to RBC~5 is the work by \citet[][hereafter C11]{2011AJ....141...61C},
subsequently updated by \citet[][hereafter CR16]{2016ApJ...824...42C}.

C11 and CR16 present a uniform set of spectroscopic observations calibrated
on the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Milky Way }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{MW }\DIFaddend GCS of the inner $1.6^\circ~({\sim}21)$~kpc that
is believed to be 94\% complete. GCs in the outer stellar halo, up to
$R_{\text{proj}}\sim150$~kpc, are observed in the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological
Survey \citep[PAndAS, ][hereafter H14]{2014MNRAS.442.2165H}, but see also
\citet{2014MNRAS.442.2929V} and \citet{2019MNRAS.484.1756M}. H14 presents the
discovery of 59 new GCs and publishes updates to RBC~5. The work of H14 is
incorporated in the latest public release\footnote{Last revised 23 Sep 2015, see
\url{https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/oir/eg/m31clusters/M31_Hectospec.html}}
of the C11 dataset, further revised by CR16. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{It seems that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We use }\DIFaddend CR16 \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{because it }\DIFaddend is the most
recent aggregated dataset of M31's GCS that contains properties of interest
for our study \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{as it contains }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and it includes }\DIFaddend GCs in the inner region and in the outer halo. The
relevant fields in the CR16 dataset that we use are the age, metallicity, and the
mass-estimate\footnote{The authors assumed $M/L_V = 2$ independent of [Fe/H]}.
Radii are calculated from RA and DEC, further discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:Rgc}.

\subsection{Age-estimates}
The top panel of Figure~\ref{fig:MW-M31-age-Rgc} shows a histogram of the age-estimates
of the $55$ MW GCs in V13 and $88$ GCs in M31 for which age-estimates are available
in CR16. The mean age of the MW GCs in this data set is $11.9 \pm 0.1$~Gyr and the 
dispersion is $0.8$~Gyr. Furthermore, only one of the 55 GC age-estimates is
below $10$~Gyr. The M31 GCS has a mean age of $11.0 \pm 0.2$~Gyr with a dispersion 
of $2.2$~Gyr, and $24$ GCs have age-estimates below $10$~Gyr with a minimum age 
of $4.8$~Gyr. Based on these data, we find that the age distributions of the MW 
and M31 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{GCS's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GCSs }\DIFaddend are not statistically consistent. Moreover, the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Milky Way }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{MW }\DIFaddend appears 
to host a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{globular cluster system }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GCS }\DIFaddend that is somewhat older than \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the Andromeda galaxy,
which }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that of M31.
This }\DIFaddend is somewhat surprising given that M31 is generally considered to be earlier
type than the MW meaning that an older stellar population would \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{naively be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{be naively }\DIFaddend expected.
However, we do caution that both data sets are incomplete and the age 
measurements have large uncertainties (of $1-2$~Gyr). On the other hand, the 
magnitude of the uncertainty is insufficient to explain the low-age tail in M31.

\subsection{Radial distribution}
\label{sec:Rgc}
The bottom panel of Figure~\ref{fig:MW-M31-age-Rgc} shows the radial distribution
of the MW and M31 GCS. Both quantities are readily available in H96e10 (assuming
$R_{\odot}=8.0$~kpc), but the galactocentric radius of GCs in M31 is not available
in CR16. Therefore\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend we follow \citet[][Sec.~4.1]{2019arXiv190111229W} to calculate
the projected radius $R_{\text{proj}}$ from the observed positions, adopting M31's
central position from the NASA Extragalactic 
Database\footnote{\url{https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/}} $(\alpha_0, \, \delta_0) =
(0^{\text{h}}42^{\text{m}}44.35^{\text{s}}, \, +41^{\circ}16'08.63")$
and distance $D_{\text{M31}} = 780$~kpc \citep{2005MNRAS.356..979M,2012ApJ...758...11C}.
We calculate \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$R_{\text{GC}}$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$R_{\text{gal}}$ }\DIFaddend as `average deprojected distance`
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$R_{\text{GC}} = R_{\text{proj}} \times (4/\pi)$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$R_{\text{gal}} = R_{\text{proj}} \times (4/\pi)$}\DIFaddend . 

The solid lines show the distributions using all available data (because the
sky coordinates are known for each GC), while the subset for which age-estimates
are available is indicated using dotted lines. The latter shows a narrower range
of radii than the full data set: it appears that \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{few }\DIFaddend age-estimates are \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{neither
}\DIFdelend available 
for the innermost ($<1$~kpc) GCs, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{nor }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and none }\DIFaddend for those beyond roughly twenty
kpc (the halo GCs). We compare both distributions of the full data set (solid 
lines) and find that the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Milky Way }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{MW }\DIFaddend has more GCs in the range $1-4$~kpc than M31
(when accounting for the larger number of total GCs in M31). Interestingly, both
distributions show a similar trend for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$R_{\text{GC}} > 4$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$R_{\text{gal}} > 4$}\DIFaddend ~kpc and host a 
subpopulation of halo GCs. However, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{both }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the two }\DIFaddend radial distributions are not statistically
consistent \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with being drawn from the same underlying distribution }\DIFaddend due to substantial 
differences at intermediate radii.

\subsection{Total GC mass in metallicity-radial space} \label{sec:observations_FeHRgc}
We show the two-dimensional mass-weighted metallicity-radial distribution of the
MW (M31) GCS in the top (bottom) panel of Figure~\ref{fig:observations_FeHRgc}. 
The observations indicate that
no GCs with high metallicities are to be expected at large radii (the three bins
in the upper right corner, both for MW and M31), and relatively few GCs at large
radii in general (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$R_{\text{GC}} > 30$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$R_{\text{gal}} > 30$}\DIFaddend ~kpc; right column: $11$ GCs or 7.3\% in
the MW and $17$ or 4.6\% in M31). Moreover, the M31 hosts more metal-rich 
([Fe/H]$ > -1$) GCs in each radial bin in comparison to the MW GCSs than what
would be expected when accounting for the fact that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Andromeda }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{M31 }\DIFaddend hosts a larger \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{GC 
system }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GCS
}\DIFaddend than the MW. Finally, given that both marginalized (i.e. the metallicity 
and radial) distributions are not statistically consistent, we find that the 
two-dimensional distributions are also not consistent. More generally, the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{GC
systems of the Milky Way and that of Andromeda both differ significantly}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GCS
of the MW differs significantly from that of M31}\DIFaddend . We compare these 
observations to the Auriga simulations later on in Sec.~\ref{sec:results_FeHRgc}.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
We define GC candidates in the Auriga simulations as all star particles older
than $10$~Gyr based on the age distribution of the MW GCS (top panel of 
Figure~\ref{fig:MW-M31-age-Rgc}), and following \citet{2017MNRAS.465.3622R}.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Troughout }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Throughout }\DIFaddend our analysis we compare \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the distributions of three subsets of star
particles: }\emph{\DIFdel{old stars}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{distributions of age-selected GC 
candidates }\DIFaddend (age $>10$~Gyr\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, or GC
candidates ), }\emph{\DIFdel{old in~situ}}
%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{stars }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{) with those of all star particles (i.e.
when no additional selection criterion is applied). We further split the GC
candidates into an }{\it \DIFadd{in~situ}} \DIFadd{subset }\DIFaddend (defined as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{those }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GC candidates that are 
}\DIFaddend bound to the most-massive halo/subhalo in the first snapshot that the particle 
was recorded), and \DIFdelbegin \emph{\DIFdel{old accreted}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{star particles
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{an accreted subpopulation }\DIFaddend (those that have formed {\it ex~situ} and 
are bound to the most-massive halo/subhalo at $z=0$). \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For comparison we also include the results for }\emph{\DIFdel{all stars}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{(when
no additional selection criterion is applied to the star particles)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A GC candidate either formed
}{\it \DIFadd{in~situ}} \DIFadd{or it was accreted}\DIFaddend . We consider the metallicity distribution in 
Sec.~\ref{sec:results_FeH}, the distribution of galactocentric radii in 
Sec.~\ref{sec:results_Rgc}, and the combination of both 
in Sec.~\ref{sec:results_FeHRgc}.


\subsection{Metallicity distribution}
\label{sec:results_FeH}
We investigate whether the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{star formation }\DIFdelend model implemented in Auriga produces metallicity 
distributions consistent with the MW and M31 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{GC systems}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GCSs}\DIFaddend , and whether
the simulations generate sufficient total mass at metallicities typical for the
MW and M31 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{GCS's}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GCSs}\DIFaddend . To visually inspect the former we show the normalized metallicity 
distribution of three specific Auriga galaxies in Figure~\ref{fig:Au4-10and21_FeH}
in comparison to the MW and M31 [Fe/H] distributions.

We find that the age cut, on average, lowers the mean metallicity \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$<$}[\DIFadd{Fe/H}]\DIFadd{$>$ }\DIFaddend from 
$0.0$ to $-0.6$. Furthermore, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the old accreted stars }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{accreted GC candidates }\DIFaddend generally have lower mean 
metallicities than the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{old }\DIFdelend {\it in~situ} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{stars }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{subset }\DIFaddend with differences of roughly
${\sim}0.3$\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~dex }\DIFaddend for the majority of the simulation runs. This behaviour can be 
seen in \mbox{Au4-21}, while a slightly larger difference of ${\sim}0.5$\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~}\DIFaddend dex is 
seen for \mbox{Au4-10} (as plotted), \mbox{Au4-16}, \mbox{Au4-17}, \mbox{Au4-18} 
and \mbox{Au4-22}. However, this trend is reversed for \mbox{Au4-1} and \mbox{Au4-4} 
for which the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{old }\DIFdelend {\it in~situ} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{population

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We caution that }\DIFdelend \mbox{Au4-1} is undergoing a major merger at redshift zero and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{note that }\DIFdelend we find 
$\mu = -1.51 \, ({-0.74})$ for the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{old }\DIFdelend {\it in~situ} (accreted) \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GC candidates,

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{only }\DIFaddend ${10.8}$\% of the GC candidates is classified as {\it in~situ} (compared to 
{\it in~situ} fractions of ${40-80}$\% for other haloes). \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We note that \mbox{Au4-4}
has undergone a major merger around 2~Gyr lookback time, which is probably why

We show the mean metallicity and standard deviation of all thirty Auriga L4 haloes
in Figure~\ref{fig:FeH_mu_sigma} to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{show }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{illustrate }\DIFaddend the behaviour for the full set of Auriga
galaxies. The green crosses are to be compared to the purple (magenta) cross, 
which shows the mean value of all MW (M31) GCs. In addition, we show the metal-rich 
(metal-poor) population of the MW GCS using a solid (open) dot. We caution that
these literature values result from individual Gaussian fits to sub sets of the 
observational data cut at [Fe/H]~$= -1$. We do not include corresponding data 
points calculated using such an artificial cut for the simulated star particles.
Having said that, we do find it interesting that the mean metallicities of the 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{old }\DIFdelend {\it in~situ} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{populations }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GC candidates }\DIFaddend appear roughly consistent with that of the metal-rich 
population of the MW although the simulations show larger dispersions. The latter 
could simply be caused by the hard separation of the MW data into two groups, 
which means the range is smaller and the resulting dispersion lower. With 
regard to the M31 GCS, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we are uncertain whether definitive consensus is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{so far no definitive consensus has been }\DIFaddend reached
in the literature concerning uni- bi- or trimodality in the [Fe/H] distribution, 
but CR16 argues that the data, after removal of younger objects due to improved 
age classification, hints at three populations separated at [Fe/H]~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$>-0.4$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$=-0.4$ }\DIFaddend and 
[Fe/H]~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$ < 1.5$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$ = 1.5$}\DIFaddend . None of the Auriga sub sets has a mean value that offers much 
hope that the simulated distribution is consistent with the lowest metallicity 
group in the M31 GCS. This is also true for the metal-poor population of the 
MW with a mean value of $-1.6$. The main take-away from this plot, again, is 
that all Auriga L4 galaxies have metallicity distributions with (much) larger
mean values than what is observed for the MW and M31 GCS, and that we 
systematically find lower mean metallicities for the accreted GC candidates
than for those that have formed {\it in~situ}.

% Finally, we test the null hypothesis that MW (M31) and the GC candidates (all,
% {\it in~situ}, and accreted) are drawn from the same underlying distribution 
% by calculating the KS test statistic (i.e. six KS tests per simulation). We 
% reject $H_0$ at the 100.00~\% confidence level for virtually all subsets of all 
% simulations, both for MW and M31, except when comparing the old accreted stars 
% of \mbox{Au4-10} to the MW GCS. In this case we still reject $H_0$ with, but 
% with $\leq 98.68$~\% confidence. When comparing to the M31 GCS, the `best' 
% matches are the old accreted subpopulations of \mbox{Au4-13}, \mbox{Au4-15}, and 
% \mbox{Au4-17} ($H_0$ rejected with $\leq$ 99.82~\% confidence, 99.95~\%,
% and 98.32~\%). Here we find that the cumulative distributions are more or less
% similar up to [Fe/H]~$-0.5$, above which the simulations yield higher number
% counts which drives the KS test statistic over the critical values. This affirms
% our finding that the simulations produce GC candidates that are more metal-rich
% than the MW (M31) GCS. The main reasons that $H_0$ is rejected with such
% high confidence are under-production of old stars with [Fe/H]~$\leq$~-1.5,
% and over-production of stars with [Fe/H]$\geq$~-0.5.

        \label{fig:FeH}
    }
\end{figure}
We now turn to the second goal, which is to see whether sufficient total mass in 
GC candidates is produced by the Auriga simulations. To answer this question we plot
a mass-weighted metallicity distribution in Figure~\ref{fig:FeH}. We show the 
median \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(coloured lines) }\DIFdelend for all thirty Auriga L4 haloes with the $1\sigma$ interval around it 
(shaded regions, which shows the scatter between runs that have different initial 
conditions, thus, have unique merger histories). We chose to aggregate the data 
to indicate general trends that we find when the GC candidates are split up \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{according to birth location}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{into
the accreted and }{\it \DIFadd{in situ}} \DIFadd{subsets}\DIFaddend , rather than selecting typical examples 
of individual (simulated) galaxies. Once again we notice that the peak metallicity 
shifts down from \DIFaddbegin [\DIFadd{Fe/H}]\DIFadd{~=~}\DIFaddend $0$ to \DIFaddbegin [\DIFadd{Fe/H}]\DIFadd{~=~}\DIFaddend $-0.6$ for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{old stars (green solid) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GC candidates }\DIFaddend compared to all stars\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(green dotted)}\DIFdelend , 
and we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{learn }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{find }\DIFaddend that the mass at the peak lowers by roughly one dex. The mass budget 
of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{old stars }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GC candidates }\DIFaddend is dominated by the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{old }\DIFdelend {\it in~situ} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{population (blue 
solid) below }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{subpopulation above
}\DIFaddend [Fe/H]~=~$-1$, and by the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{old accreted stars (red solid) above }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{accreted subset below }\DIFaddend this value. We show the MW (M31) 
GCS in purple (magenta) and notice that the difference between the MW and M31 
distributions is substantially larger than the scatter between different Auriga 
galaxies, particularly around [Fe/H]~$=-1$. In addition, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Andromeda }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{M31 }\DIFaddend does host 
(a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{hand full}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{handful of}\DIFaddend ) GCs with [Fe/H]~$< -2.5$ as well as GCs with [Fe/H]~$ > 0$ while 
the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Milky Way }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{MW }\DIFaddend does not.

We show the ratio of the  simulated to the observed profiles in the middle (bottom) 
panel. This mass excess can be thought of the `mass budget' that the Auriga GC 
candidates can `afford to lose' due to a combination of smaller than unity bound
cluster formation efficiencies combined with a Hubble time of dynamical evolution,
while still producing sufficient mass at the right metallicities. In particular,
the cluster formation efficiency would have to decrease with decreasing 
metallicity for Auriga GC candidates to produce a population of GC candidates 
that is consistent with the MW. For the GC candidates in M31 we find a constant 
mass \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{excess up to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ratio up to }[\DIFadd{Fe/H}]\DIFadd{=}\DIFaddend $-0.9$, above which the simulations produce a higher mass \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{excess 
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ratio 
}\DIFaddend with increasing metallicity. If dynamical evolution is not expected to more 
efficiently disrupt GCs of higher metallicity, then we would find that the 
efficiency to form bound star clusters would have to decrease with increasing 
metallicity.


\subsection{Radial distribution}
\label{sec:results_Rgc}

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{{LogRgc_mu_sigma-trim}.png}
    \caption{
        Mean and standard deviation of the logarithm of radial distribution 
        of star particles in each of the thirty Auriga L4 haloes compared to

        \label{fig:Rgc_mu_sigma}
    }
\end{figure}
We repeat the analysis of the previous subsection for the distribution of
galactocentric radius instead of metallicity. We look for general trends present
in all Auriga L4 galaxies. Figure~\ref{fig:Rgc_mu_sigma} shows the mean and 
standard deviation of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\log_{10}(R_{\text{GC}})$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\log_{10}(R_{\text{gal}})$ }\DIFaddend of star particles in all Auriga
L4 simulations. The purple (magenta) cross again shows the mean of the MW (M31)
GCs (which are to be compared to the green crosses), but solid (open) dot now
shows our calculation of the mean value of the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{`red' }\DIFaddend metal-rich (\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{`blue` }\DIFaddend metal-poor) 
population\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{as no literature values were available}\DIFdelend . We split the radii up into the metal-rich/metal-poor groups by taking
a metallicity cut at [Fe/H]~=~-1 as is done in the literature.

We notice that the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{old }\DIFdelend {\it in~situ} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{populations }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GC candidates }\DIFaddend are more centrally distributed, 
whereas the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{old }\DIFdelend accreted subsets have a larger radial extent. This 
is not surprising because the classification of {\it in~situ} requires star particles 
to have formed within the virial radius, thus they could naturally be expected 
to end up at small galactocentric radii. Accreted star particles, on the other 
hand, have formed in another (sub)halo beyond the virial radius, thus, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{they }\DIFaddend would 
first have to migrate inwards in order to populate the innermost radii. Moreover,
we find that the simulations have a wider dispersion in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\log(R_{\text{GC}}$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\log(R_{\text{gal}})$ }\DIFaddend than
the MW GCS, while the dispersion of M31 seems to lie \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{witin }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{within }\DIFaddend the range of dispersions
found in the Auriga galaxies. Furthermore, the mean of the MW GCS lies roughly 
within the range of values produced by the Auriga simulations, whereas the mean 
of M31 is somewhat larger and slightly closer to typical mean values of the 
accreted GC candidates in the Auriga simulations. The larger radial extent 
of the M31 GCS is generally believed to hint at a more accretion-dominated origin 
of the GCS, and may reflect a richer accretion history of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the galaxy }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{M31 }\DIFaddend in comparison 
to the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Milky Way}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{MW}\DIFaddend .

        age $>$~10~Gyr; green solid). The latter sub set is further split up

        were accreted (red solid). Shaded regions indicate the $1\sigma$

        \label{fig:Rgc}
    }
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:Rgc} shows the mass-weighted radial distribution of the
Auriga L4 haloes. We notice a subtle peak around $10$~kpc for all star
particles that is not present for the GC candidates, indicating that the
stellar disc is no longer present when applying the latter selection criterion.
Furthermore, we find that the dominant contribution to the total mass in GC
candidates changes from those formed {\it in~situ} to the accreted population around
$10$~kpc. Again we show the mass \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{excess }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ratio }\DIFaddend of the simulations compared to the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Milky
Way and Andromeda }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{MW 
and M31 }\DIFaddend GCS. We find a decreasing mass \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{excess }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ratio }\DIFaddend with increasing radius
in the range $0.2$ to ${\sim}5$ kpc, followed by an increase attributed
to the accreted subpopulation. For the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Milky Way }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{MW }\DIFaddend we notice that significantly
fewer GCs are found beyond $40$~kpc than for M31, and that accreted GC candidates
contribute mostly to the Auriga GCS at these radii. We further investigate a 
breakdown of the total mass in Auriga GC candidates into bins of both metallicity 
and radius in the following section.

        \label{fig:Au-FeHRgc}

\end{figure}

We investigate whether the Auriga simulations still produce sufficient mass when
the GC candidates are two-dimensionally binned in [Fe/H] and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$R_\text{GC}$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$R_\text{gal}$}\DIFaddend . First
we sum the total \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{simulated mass }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{mass of GC candidates }\DIFaddend in each bin (for an individual Auriga 
simulation), then we calculate the median \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{total mass in each bin }\DIFaddend over all 
thirty Auriga L4 haloes\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(in each bin, see
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. The result is shown in }\DIFaddend Figure~\ref{fig:Au-FeHRgc}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend which 
can be compared to \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the observed total GC mass shown in

\DIFdel{We notice in Figure~\ref{fig:Au-FeHRgc} that the Auriga simulations, on average, produce fewer GCs in the lowest metallicity bins ($-2.5$ to $-1.5$) than at higher metallicities in the three innermost radial bins. In addition, Auriga produces

Note that the data in the three top right bins is masked because the mass ratio cannot

If the product of the bound cluster formation efficiency and consecutive GC

The bound cluster formation efficiency has to exceed 10\%, and none of the GC

\subsection{Metallicity distribution}
\label{sec:discussion_FeH}
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Globular clusters }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GCs }\DIFaddend are ${\sim}0.5$ dex more metal-poor than spheroid stars observed 
at the same radius for almost all galaxies \citep{1991ARA&A..29..543H}. Our 
selection function (age cut) does lower the mean metallicity \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of GC candidates }\DIFaddend by 
$0.5$ dex \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with respect to all star particles}\DIFaddend , but we still find that the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{metallicity distributions of }\DIFdelend GC 
candidates in the Auriga simulations are more metal-rich than the MW \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend M31 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{) GCS}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GCSs}\DIFaddend . 
Although the (old) star particles represent single stellar populations with a mass 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(resolution) }\DIFdelend consistent with that of GCs, they are in fact statistical tracers 
of the stellar population of the galaxy as a whole. Therefore only a (small) 
fraction of the star particles may represent plausible formation sites of GCs, 
whereas the majority represents (halo) field stars - the disk component effectively 
falls outside our selection of star particles due to the age cut. It is implausible 
that all halo stars come from disrupted GCs because \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{GC systems that survive down to redshift zero are generally }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the total mass in GCSs 
at redshift zero is generally a }\DIFaddend few orders of magnitude \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{less massive than galactic stellar haloes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{lower than the total 
mass of stellar haloes of galaxies. If stellar haloes solely consist of disrupted
GCs, then the GC disruption rate would have to be considerably higher than expected
from theoretical models. Overall, our set of GC candidates most likely contains
an overabundance of regular stars. It could be that the resulting metallicity
distribution is then biased towards higher values than what is observed for real 
GCs. An alternative explanation could overmixing of metals at early times}\DIFaddend .


In general, the colour (metallicity) distribution of most \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{GC systems }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GCSs }\DIFaddend is bimodal 
with typical separating value [Fe/H]$\sim -1$ \citep{1985ApJ...293..424Z,
1999AJ....118.1526G,2001AJ....121.2974L,2006ApJ...639...95P}. Indeed, 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

and \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet[][p. 38]{Harris2001} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{1998gcs..book.....A} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
and \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{Harris2001} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend find that the MW GCS has a 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{bimodality }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{bimodal }\DIFaddend [Fe/H] distribution\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{: the latter fit a double Gaussian 
which peaks at }%DIFDELCMD < [%%%
\DIFdel{Fe/H}%DIFDELCMD < ] %%%
\DIFdel{= $-1.59$ (metal-poor) and $-0.51$ (metal-rich) and 
dispersions of $0.34$ and $0.23$}\DIFdelend . Observations of GCs in M31, however, may be best 
split into three distinct metallicity groups \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, one found at small radii with 
}%DIFDELCMD < [%%%
\DIFdel{Fe/H}%DIFDELCMD < ] %%%
\DIFdel{$>-0.4$, one intermediate }%DIFDELCMD < [%%%
\DIFdel{Fe/H}%DIFDELCMD < ] %%%
\DIFdel{group, and a dominant (metal-poor) group 
with }%DIFDELCMD < [%%%
\DIFdel{Fe/H}%DIFDELCMD < ] %%%
\DIFdel{$< -1.5$ }\DIFdelend \citep{2016ApJ...824...42C}. The 
numerical simulation of \citet{2017MNRAS.465.3622R} does yield a bimodal 
metallicity distribution where the metal-poor population is dominated by accreted 
star particles and the metal-rich population by {\it in~situ} stars. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{However, we }\DIFaddend find that none of the Auriga simulations produces a bimodal 
metallicity distribution for age-selected GC candidates. Interestingly, the 
cross-over point above (below) which the mass-weighted metallicity distribution
of GC candidates is dominated by those that have formed {\it in~situ} (were
accreted) does coincide with the separation between the metal-rich and metal-poor
populations of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{GC systems }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GCSs }\DIFaddend at [Fe/H]~=~$-1$\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, as for the MW}\DIFaddend . Moreover, we do find 
that the mean metallicity shifts when we split the GC candidates up according 
to birth location (accreted or {\it in~situ}). In particular, the mean values of 
the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{old 
}\DIFdelend {\it in~situ} GC candidates are roughly consistent with the metal-rich MW GCs.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{However}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{On the other hand}\DIFaddend , we also notice that a substantial number of simulations has similar 
mean values for all GC candidates, and the simulated {\it in~situ} GC candidates 
have larger dispersions than the metal-rich GCs. Moreover, the offset between 
the mean of the metal-rich and metal-poor populations in the MW is $1$ dex, a
factor $2-3$ larger than the offset that we find between the {\it in~situ} and 
accreted populations. The Auriga simulations therefore do not support the view 
that the metal-poor GCs could have \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{only }\DIFaddend formed in satellites that have later been 
accreted whereas the metal-rich GC subpopulation has \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{only }\DIFaddend formed {\it in~situ}. 
With this statement, however, we do caution that \citet{2019MNRAS.486.3134K} suggests 
to reserve the `{\it ex~situ}' classification for accretion after $z=2$, when
the central galaxy has formed and accretion unambigously contributes to the
radially extended halo GC population. In fact, our classification \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{appears flawed
in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{might not hold
for }\DIFaddend Au4-1.

Finally, we note that \citet{2006ARA&A..44..193B} compares the number of metal-poor 
GCs to the stellar halo mass and find\footnote{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend quantity $T$ is the number of 
GCs per $10^9$ M\Sun \, of galaxy stellar mass\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.}\DIFaddend } $T^n_{\text{blue}} \sim 100$, 
while the number of metal-rich GCs compared to the bulge mass yields 
$T^n_{\text{red}} \sim 5$, and therefore conclude that the formation efficiency
of metal-poor GCs is twenty times higher than the metal-rich GCs with respect to 
field stars. We find that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{gradual linear }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a gradual }\DIFaddend increase in formation efficiency of GCs
with respect to field stars would be required with decreasing metallicity for
the GC candidates in the Auriga simulations to yield sufficient total mass to
be consistent with the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Milky Way GCS. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{MW or M31 GCS. In addition, the metal-poor GC candidates
would have to experience low mass los rates, especially those within the Solar
radius.
}\DIFaddend 

\subsection{Radial distribution}
\label{sec:discussion_Rgc}
The M31 GCS has a factor 2-3 more GCs at large radii compared to the MW GCS,
which may indicate that M31 has a richer merger history than the MW 
\citep{2016ApJ...824...42C}. In the Auriga simulations we find that the GC 
candidates at radii larger than ${\sim}20$~kpc are indeed dominated by accreted
star particles. However, we select star particles that are bound to the main 
halo and main subhalo, which means that we include particles up to the virial 
radius $R_{200}$. The Auriga simulations have no problem populating the stellar 
halo up to the virial radius, even with our additional age cut. On the other hand, 
the MW and M31 have fewer GCs at large radii. We expect tidal disruption to be
less efficient at larger radii, thus, the formation efficiencies of the accreted 
GC candidates would have to be lower. Our classification as GC candidates could
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, 
for example, be improved by selecting a number of globular clusters based on the $M_{vir}-N_{\text{GC}}$ correlation found by \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{2019arXiv190100900B}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, and 
taking a
virial mass below which none of the star particles is treated as GC candidate}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{especially be improved for the accreted subset. For example, we could tag only a
subset of the accreted star particles as GC candidates, where the number
number of GCs is determined by the satellite halo mass, given the 
$M_{vir}-N_{\text{gal}}$ correlation found by \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{2019arXiv190100900B}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .

\section{Summary and conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We investigate \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{statistics of age-selected ($>$~10~Gyr) }\DIFaddend GC candidates in the 
Auriga simulations and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{compare the simulations to the MW and M31 GCSs. Based on
our analysis we }\DIFaddend draw the following conclusions.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The star formation model implemented in the Auriga simulations produces
    metallicity distributions that are more metal-rich than the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Milky Way }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{MW }\DIFaddend and M31
    \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{globular cluster systems. }%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD <     \item %%%
\item%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{We reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ for any one }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GCSs. For most }\DIFaddend of the Auriga simulations \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that the GC candidates and the MW GCs are drawn from the same underlying 
    distribution. This statement holds true when we select all old star particles 
    (GC candidates), but also when we select the old accreted or the old }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{we find that the subset of accreted 
    GC candidates has a lower mean metallicity than the }\DIFaddend {\it in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{~}\DIFdelend situ} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{star particles.
    In addition, this is also the case when we test against the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{subpopulation.
    However, the accreted subsets are still more metal-rich than the MW and }\DIFaddend M31 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{GCS instead }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GCSs.
    Moreover, none of the simulated subsets has a mean metallicity as low as the mean
    of the `blue' metal-poor component }\DIFaddend of the MW GCS.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Moreover, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

    \item \DIFadd{We find that }\DIFaddend the difference between the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{metallicity distributions of 
    the }\DIFaddend MW and M31 \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GCSs }\DIFaddend is big compared to the scatter in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{GC candidate properties in the
    Auriga
    simulations}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the Auriga GC candidates 
    of different Auriga runs. The radial distributions of the MW and M31 GCSs are
    somewhat more similar, but they are not consistent with being drawn from the
    same distribution. The scatter between the radial distributions of different
    Auriga simulations is smaller than the difference between the MW and M31 GCSs}\DIFaddend .

    \item GC candidates in the Auriga simulations may be found out to $R_{200}$,
    given that our selection function of star particles selects all stars bound
    to the main subhalo in the main halo. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{stellar mass }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{total mass of GC candidates }\DIFaddend is 
    dominated by accreted star particles at radii beyond $20$~kpc. The GCs in 
    the MW and M31, on the other hand, have a much smaller radial extent.

    \item The cluster formation efficiency would have to increase with decreasing
    metallicity for GC candidates in the Auriga simulations to be consistent
    with the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Milky Way GC system}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{MW GCS}\DIFaddend , given that we expect dynamical evolution to 
    more strongly affect GC candidates at smaller radii. This trend of over-production
    of old star particles that are metal-rich and at large radii compared to 
    observed GCs is less clear for the M31 GCS.
