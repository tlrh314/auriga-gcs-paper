We investigate whether the galaxy formation model used for the Auriga simulations

properties of the simulated star particles in the Auriga haloes with
catalogues of observations of the Milky Way globular cluster population available
in the literature. We find that the Auriga simulations produce sufficient mass
at radii and metallicities that are typical for the MW GCS, although we observe
a varying mass-excess for the different $R_{\text{GC}}$-[Fe/H] bins. This implies
different values for the combined product of the bound cluster formation efficiency
and the globular cluster disruption rate. We investigate wether these differences
could result from formation insitu vs. accreted star particles. We find ...

seems appropriate in dense galactic environment leading to the
assembly of massive elliptical galaxies, like in the Virgo Cluster
as tested by \citet{2014ApJ...796...10L}, it does not apply to Milky Way-

\end{itemize}



\todo[inline]{Paragraph: narrow the scientific motivation down to the scope of 
    this particular work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The star formation model implemented in the Auriga simulations is capable of producing a suite/population of realistic Milky Way-like galaxies at redshift zero.
    \item (However) State of the art simulations still face numerical restrictions that requires a subgrid approach to star formation and feedback because individual stars (and their evolution) cannot yet be accounted for. Star formation thus occurs in a heuristic/probabilistic fashion for gas cells that fulfill some star formation criterion. The star particles enrich the gas with metals and energy, both according to pre-defined/pre-calculated yields for specific feedback processes (supernova type I and II, strong stellar winds of asymptotic giant branch stars, ). In addition, black holes are seeded in eligible haloes to account for feedback associated with an active galactic nucleus.
    \item The end-result of the star formation model is the production of simulated Milky Way-like galaxies. Therefore the question naturally arises whether or not the Auriga simulations are also capable of faithfully producing a globular cluster population as observed in the Milky Way.
    \item Globular cluster formation in cosmological zoom simulations is very interesting for two reasons. First of all, extragalactic observations typically show the integrated properties of globular clusters rather than that of the individual stars within the clusters. Moreover, the typical mass scale of globular clusters is comparable to the numerical (mass) resolution of cosmological zoom simulations. The detailed small scale physics that is at play for real world globular clusters appears in observations as the combined effect of the $10^{3-6}$ M\Sun, compared to a mass resolution of $10^{3-5}$ M\Sun for the Auriga simulations. Globular clusters can therefore serve as an ultimate test to the star formation model that is implemented in the numerical simulations. Secondly, cosmological zoom simulations provide an accurate recording of the full and detailed merger history of the simulated galaxy. This is important because theoretical paradigms for globular cluster formation in the literature know two distinct classes of GCs that are separated by their exact formation sites: an in-situ versus an accreted population. Cosmological zoom simulations uniquely allow for an investigation into globular cluster formation with particular focus on the in-situ and accreted populations.
\end{itemize}


\todo[inline]{Paragraph: Paper outline}
We summarise the relevant characteristics of the Auriga simulations in 
section~\ref{sec:auriga}, followed by a summary of the observations of the
Milky Way (MW) globular cluster system (GCS) in section~\ref{sec:observations}
that we use to compare our simulations to in section~\ref{sec:results}. We
discuss our findings in section~\ref{sec:discussion} to come to our conclusions 
in section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.


\section{The Auriga simulations}
\label{sec:auriga}
We use the Auriga simulations \citep[][hereafter G17]{2017MNRAS.467..179G}, a 
suite of high-resolution cosmological zoom simulations ran with a galaxy
formation model that produces realistic Milky Way-like galaxies at redshift
$z=0$. The simulations are performed with the state-of-the art code \textsc{arepo}
\citep{2010MNRAS.401..791S, 2016MNRAS.455.1134P} that solves the 
magnetohydrodynamical equations on a moving mesh.

The interstellar medium is modelled using a sub-grid approach which implements
the physical processes most relevant to galaxy formation and evolution. 
This model was tailored to the \textsc{arepo} code and calibrated to reproduce
key observables of galaxies, such as the history of the cosmic star formation rate 
density, the stellar mass to halo mass relation, and galaxy luminosity functions.

The sub-grid includes primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections.
Reionization is completed at redshift six by a time-varying spatially uniform UV 
background \citep{2009ApJ...703.1416F, 2013MNRAS.436.3031V}
The interstellar medium is described by an equation of state for a two-phase medium
in pressure equilibrium \citep{2003MNRAS.339..289S} with stochastic star formation
in thermally unstable gas with a density threshold of $n = 0.13 \text{cm}^{-3}$,
and consecutive stellar evolution is accounted for. Stars provide feedback by 
stellar winds \citep{2014MNRAS.437.1750M, 2017MNRAS.467..179G}, and further 
enrich the ISM with metals from SNIa, SNII, and AGB stars \citep{2013MNRAS.436.3031V}.
The formation of black holes is modelled which results in feedback from active 
galactic nuclei \citep{2005MNRAS.361..776S, 2014MNRAS.437.1750M, 2017MNRAS.467..179G}.
Finally, the simulations follow the evolution of a magnetic field of $10^{-14}$
(comoving)~G seeded at $z = 127$ \citep{2013MNRAS.432..176P, 2014ApJ...783L..20P}.
See G17 for further details of the numerical setup as well as the galaxy formation
model.

\section{Relevant observational data}
\label{sec:observations}
The galaxy formation model implemented for the Auriga simulations produces
realistic spiral galaxies at redshift zero. Therefore we aim to compare the
simulations to the globular cluster systems of the spiral galaxies in the 
Local Group (i.e. the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxy, M31). Here we summarise 
the relevant data available in the literature.

\subsection{Milky Way: Harris catalogue}
\label{sec:harris}
\citet[][2010 edition; hereafter H96]{1996AJ....112.1487H} provides a fairly
up-to-date catalogue of the Milky Way globular cluster system containing the
properties of 157 globular clusters. An additional 59 GCs have since been 
discovered, 2 of which by \citet{2018ApJ...863L..38R}. The authors also provide 
a comprehensive list of references to other discovery papers, and they predict 
that the Milky Way GCS contains an additional 30 undiscovered GCs that are 
obscured by the Galactic disk. Recently, \citet{2019arXiv190108574C} announced
the discovery of three new GCs, totalling to the MW GCS to 218. This would make
the Harris catalogue roughly 65\% complete. However, we do not use the properties 
of the more recently discovered GCs in our analysis.

The relevant data fields that we use from H96 are the metallicity [Fe/H],
galactocentric radius $R_{\text{GC}}$, and absolute magnitude in the V-band 
$M_V$. We use the latter to calculate mass-estimates by assuming $M_{V,\odot}=4.83$
and a mass to light ratio $M/L_V = 1.7$~M/L$_{\odot}$, the mean for MW clusters
\citep{2005ApJS..161..304M}.

\url{http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/viz-bin/VizieR-3?-source=J/ApJS/161/304/clusters}}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:MW-FeHRgc} we show the two-dimensional mass-weighted 
metallicity-radial distribution of the MW GCS. In Sec.~\ref{sec:FeHRgc} 
we investigate whether the star formation model implemented in the Auriga 
simulations can produce sufficient total mass in GC candidates in the same bins.

        is 98.19 \% of the total MW GCS mass in the Harris catalog.
        \label{fig:MW-FeHRgc}
    }
\end{figure}

\subsection{Milky Way: VandenBerg catalogue}
\label{sec:vandenberg}
\citet[][hereafter V13]{2013ApJ...775..134V} used photometric data to obtain 
[Fe/H] measurements and age-estimates for 55 globular clusters in the Milky Way.
The mean value of the age-estimates in this data set is $11.9 \pm 0.1$~Gyr and 
the dispersion is 0.9~Gyr. Furthermore, only one of the 55 GC age-estimates is
below 10~Gyr. Therefore we define GC candidates in the Auriga simulations as
all star particles older than 10~Gyr in Sec.~\ref{sec:results}.

\subsection{Andromeda: Caldwell catalogue}
\label{sec:m31}
\citet[][, hereafter C11]{2011AJ....141...61C} studied globular clusters in the
Andromeda (M31) galaxy. The relevant fields in this data set are the age, 
metallicities, and absolute visual magnitude.
\todo[inline]{

e.g. Strader, Caldwell \& Seth 2011).''
}
For M31 we find an age distribution with a mean value of 10.8$\pm 10.8$~Gyr and a 
dispersion of 2.3~Gyr. Furthermore, 27 GCs have age-estimates below 10~Gyr, and
the minimum age is 4.8~Gyr.

This text sits here just for debug purposes, just for now. We calculate the 
projected and `inferred' galactocentric radius from the observed coordinates.
\begin{align}
    \cos \theta & = \sin \delta_1 \sin \delta_2 +
        \cos \delta_1 \cos \delta_2 \cos \left( \alpha_1 - \alpha_2 \right),
\end{align}
where $(\alpha_1, \delta_1)$ are the right ascension and declination (in degrees,
converted to radians) of the centroid of M31 and $(\alpha_2, \delta_2)$ are the
observed coordinates of the globular cluster. The angle on the sky is converted
to a physical distance in kpc using the small angle approximation, i.e. 
$r_{\text{projected}} = \theta \cdot D_{\text{M31}}$. We adopt the values 
$(\alpha_1, \delta_1) = (0^{\text{h}}42^{\text{m}}44.3^{\text{s}}, 
+41^{\circ}16'9")$ (TODO: reference), and  $D_{\text{M31}} = 778$~kpc 
(TODO: reference).

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
Through out the analysis we use six sub sets of star particles: \emph{all stars}, 
and \emph{old stars} (age $>10$~Gyr, GC candidates hereafter). Both sub sets are
further split up in (old) star particles that have formed \emph{in-situ} 
(bound to the most-massive halo/subhalo in the first snapshot that the star 
particle was recorded), and (old) \emph{accreted} star particles (i.e. those that 
have formed ex-situ and are bound to the most-massive halo/subhalo at $z=0$). 
We use an age threshold of 10~Gyr for GC candidates because the mean 
age-estimate of the $55$ MW GCs in V13 is $11.9\pm0.1$~Gyr with a dispersion of 
$0.8$~Gyr, and only one observed GC lies outside this range.

In Sec.~\ref{sec:metallicity} we investigate the metallicity distribution of the
GC candidates, in Sec.~\ref{sec:radial} we show the distribution of galactocentric
radii of the globular cluster candidates within the Auriga simulations, and we 
combine both in Sec.~\ref{sec:FeHRgc}. We continue our analysis with an investigation
of the properties of the proto-galaxies at times of birth of the accreted globular 
cluster population in Sec.~\ref{sec:birth-properties-of-accreted-gc-candidates}

\subsection{Metallicity distribution}
\label{sec:metallicity}
We investigate whether the star formation model implemented in the Auriga 
simulations is capable of producing sufficient mass in old star particles in 
each metallicity bin in comparison to the Milky Way and Andromeda globular 
cluster systems. In Fig.~\ref{fig:FeH} we show a mass-weighted metallicity 
distribution where the lines show the median value of all thirty Auriga level 4 
haloes for \emph{all stars} (orange dotted), \emph{old stars / GC candidates} 
(orange solid), \emph{old in-situ} stars (blue solid), and \emph{old accreted} stars
(red solid). The shaded regions indicate the $1\sigma$ interval around the median 
(i.e. the scatter between runs with different initial conditions and merger
histories). The MW (M31) GCS is shown in purple (magenta). We use the 
same bin sizes for the simulations as for the observations, explicitly shown for
the observed profiles.

The peak of the distribution shifts down from [Fe/H] $\thicksim 0.0$ to 
$\thicksim -0.6$ for the \emph{old stars} compared to \emph{all stars} while the 
mass at the peak lowers by roughly one dex. Moreover, we find that the 
metallicity range $-3 <$ [Fe/H] $< -1$ is only populated by the GC candidates, 
while [Fe/H] $> -1$ is dominated by star particles younger than 10~Gyr.
Furthermore, the \emph{old accreted} sub set contributes most significantly to 
the range $-3 <$ [Fe/H] $< -1$, and the contribution of the \emph{old in-situ}
stars at these metallicities declines steeper with declining metallicity 
than the \emph{old accreted} population. We note that the scatter between different
Auriga haloes is much smaller than the difference between the MW and M31 GCSs.
We conclude that old star particles in the Auriga simulation suite as a whole 
cannot be consistent with both the Milky Way and the Andromeda globular cluster
system.

The middle (bottom) panel shows the ratio of the simulated mass to the mass in
the MW (M31) GCS. We observe an increasing trend with increasing metallicity 
for the Milky Way over the entire range of the data, while the M31 GCS shows
this increase only in the range [Fe/H]$>$-0.5 (although not for the \emph{old
accreted} component.


Furthermore we test the null hypothesis that the metallicity distribution of the
MW (M31) GCS and the \emph{old}, \emph{old insitu}, and \emph{old accreted} star 
particles in the Auriga simulations are drawn from the same underlying 
distribution. We calculate the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic for
all thirty Auriga level 4 haloes and reject the null hypothesis for every halo, 
for every sub set of star particles at least at the 99.99\% confidence level.
In addition, the null hypothesis that the metallicity distributions of the MW 
and M31 GCS are drawn from the same distribution is rejected at the 99.99997\%
confidence level.

% We notice a scatter\footnote{Here scatter means the width of the 1$\sigma$ interval.
% The difference between the minimum and maximum values is $0.9$~dex.} in mass

\subsection{From star particles to globular clusters}
\label{sec:star-to-gc}
Star particles are not globular clusters. Many stars do form in clusters, but
not all clusters end up gravitationally bound. Star particles in the
Auriga simulations represent single-age stellar populations that have formed
at the same location within the galaxy. Therefore one could assume a model
for the star cluster formation efficiency $\Gamma$, which could be used to 
`convert' star particles to bound star clusters e.g. Kruijssen (2012). This 
model relies on the local birth properties of the star particles. However, 
in our analysis we can retrieve the properties of the star particle in the 
first snapshot it was recorded, but not the gas properties at times of birth.
Therefore we are unable to model the formation of star clusters in more detail.

Furthermore, we compare star particles to present-day globular clusters, thereby
ignoring the effects of (dynamical) disruption of globular clusters over nearly
a Hubble time. As shown by Pfeffer et al. (2018), a detailed model of the tidal
history of star clusters requires a temporal resolution of order mega year. For
the Auriga level 4 simulations we have 128 snapshots for the age of the Universe,
thus, a far too coarse temporal resolution for meaningful calculations.

Therefore we investigate the over-production of simulated mass in the metallicity
and radial bins and use the term `efficiency' to refer to the combined product
of bound cluster formation and globular cluster disruption. In Fig.~\ref{fig:todo} 
we show the efficiencies that we find when we compare the simulations to the 
globular cluster systems of the Milky Way as well as that of Andromeda (M31).

\subsection{Age-metallicity distribution}

\subsection{Formation history} 
\label{sec:history}
Can we identify particular star formation events that generate GC candidates with the correct age, metallicity, and radial properties as expected or the MW GCS?

Can we distinguish between particles that have formed in-situ and those that have been accreted? Can we identify specific features in the age-metallicity plane, or in the $R_\textbf{GC}$-[Fe/H] plane, that result from one of both populations? How does this connect to proposed mechanisms for globular cluster formation in the literature?

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

We investigate all star particles in the Auriga simulations that are older than 10~Gyr,
an approach equal to the method of \citep{2017MNRAS.465.3622R}. This approach does not
take the bound cluster fraction \citep[e.g.][]{2012MNRAS.426.3008K} into account. This
means that our sub set, which is based on selection by age, comprises both stars in the
field as well as globular clusters. We compare the total mass in the simulations in 
metallicity ([Fe/H]), galactocentric radius $R_{\text{GC}}$, and [Fe/H]-$R_{\text{GC}}$ 
bins to the total mass in the MW GCS (using the H96 data set). The mass excess in the
simulations gives a maximum mass loss `budget' for the product of cluster formation 
efficiency and dynamical evolution. We find fractions that vary with metallicity,
radius and metallicity-and-radius.

\todo[inline]{
``The fraction of all star formation that occurs in bound stellar clusters (the cluster formation efficiency, hereafter CFE) follows by integration of these local clustering and survival properties over the full density spectrum of the ISM, and hence is set by galaxy-scale physics. We derive the CFE as a function of observable galaxy properties, and find that it increases with the gas surface density'' \citep{2012MNRAS.426.3008K}

\section{Scatter between individual Auriga haloes, and numerical convergence} 
\label{sec:scatter-convergence}
We check whether the properties of the Auriga globular cluster candidates 
are well converged between the three different resolution levels used for the 
Auriga simulations. Here we consider all three Auriga haloes for which simulation
runs were performed at all three resolution levels: Au6, Au16, and Au24. Here
we can investigate differences between individual haloes. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:logMFeH_res} shows the mass-weighted metallicity distribution, 
Fig.~\ref{fig:logMRgc_res} shows the mass-weighted radial distribution, and
