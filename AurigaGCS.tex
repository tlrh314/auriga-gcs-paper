% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
We investigate whether the galaxy formation model used for the Auriga simulations 
can produce a realistic globular cluster population at redshift zero. We compare
properties of the simulated star particles in selected Auriga haloes with
catalogues of observations of the Milky Way globular cluster population available
in the literature. We find that the Auriga simulations produce sufficient mass
at radii and metallicities that are typical for the MW GCS, although we observe
a varying mass-excess for the different $R_{\text{GC}}$-[Fe/H] bins. This implies
different values for the combined product of the bound cluster formation efficiency
and the globular cluster disruption rate.

\section{Introduction}
\todo[inline]{Paragraph: General introduction of GCs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``GCs among oldest astrophysical objects. GCs form in the early Universe in highest density peaks \citep[e.g.][]{2005MNRAS.364..367D, 2009ApJ...706L.192B}''
    \item ``Hence, they witness most of the formation and evolution processes of galaxies, and can be used to probe them'' \citep{2006ARA&A..44..193B}
    \item ``colour bimodality, blue and red clusters \citep[e.g.][]{1985ApJ...293..424Z, 1999AJ....118.1526G, 2001AJ....121.2974L, 2006ApJ...639...95P}
    \item ``blue metal-poor (with distribution peaking at [Fe/H] $\approx -1.5$ for the Milky Way), no sign of rotation as a population (..) more metal-rich (peak at [Fe/H] $\approx -0.5$ in the Milky  Way) more spatially concentrated and rotating with the galaxy.'' \citep{1996AJ....112.1487H}
\end{itemize}


\todo[inline]{Paragraph: ``Bimodality suggests two formation mechanisms''}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``Blue clusters from in early Universe in galaxies that merge later. In (wet) merger process starbursts generate red population \cite{1992ApJ...384...50A, 1987nngp.proc...18S}''
    \item ``\citet{1997AJ....113.1652F} propose instead that blue globulars form when the protogalaxy itself collapses, in a metal-poor and turbulence media. The red population would form later, once the galactic disc has settled. The formation of globular clusters would then be a multiphase process, with the first phase being interrupted possibly by cosmic reionization \citep{2002MNRAS.333..383B}.''
    \item ``\citet{2005ApJ...623..650K, 2014ApJ...796...10L} advocate
that major mergers are at the origin of both sub-populations: blue
clusters form during early mergers (z > 4) while the red ones appear
in mergers at lower redshifts (even after z = 1). Although, this
scenario, combined with star formation enhancement in mergers,
seems appropriate in dense galactic environment leading to the
assembly of massive elliptical galaxies, like in the Virgo Cluster
as tested by \citet{2014ApJ...796...10L}, it does not apply to Milky Way-
like systems where no recent major merger took place (Wyse 2001;
Deason et al. 2013; Ruchti et al. 2014, 2015).
\item ``\citet{1998ApJ...501..554C} argue that red clusters form in situ while the blue ones are accreted, either via merging satellite galaxies, or by tidal capture of the clusters themselves \citep[see also][]{2013ApJ...762...39T}.''

\section{Methodology and definitions}
\label{sec:methods}
\subsection{The Auriga Simulations}
\label{sec:auriga}
We use the Auriga \citep[][hereafter G17]{2017MNRAS.467..179G} simulations, a suite of high-resolution cosmological zoom simulations ran with a galaxy formation model that produces realistic Milky Way-like galaxies at redshift $z=0$. The simulations are performed with \textsc{arepo} \citep{2010MNRAS.401..791S, 2016MNRAS.455.1134P} that solves the magnetohydrodynamical equations on a moving mesh. See G17 for further details; here we briefly summarise the relevant properties.
