\begin{abstract}
\todo[inline]{Rob Grand: `for many Auriga papers Carlos Frenk and Adrian Jenkins
are offered co-authorship. Perhaps you could ask Simon about this.'}
We investigate whether the galaxy formation model used for the Auriga simulations
can produce a realistic globular cluster population at redshift zero. We compare
properties of the simulated star particles in the Auriga haloes with
catalogues of observations of the Milky Way globular cluster population available
in the literature. We find that the Auriga simulations do produce sufficient mass
at radii and metallicities that are typical for the MW GCS, although we observe
a varying mass-excess for the different $R_{\text{GC}}$-[Fe/H] bins. This implies
different values for the combined product of the bound cluster formation efficiency
and the globular cluster disruption rate. We investigate wether these differences
could result from formation insitu vs. accreted star particles. We find ... TODO.
Furthermore we test whether any of the Auriga galaxies has a metallicity and radial
distribution that is consistent with the MW (M31) GCS. For all of the Auriga haloes
we reject the null hypothesis that the simulated and observed metallicities are
drawn from the same distribution at the 99.99\% confidence level, for the GCS
of the Milky Way as well as that of the Andromeda galaxy. The same holds true for
the distribution of galactocentric radius.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}
Globular clusters (GC)s are omnipresent, bright, old, and amongst the simplest
stellar configurations in the Universe. The globular cluster systems (GCS) of
the Milky Way (MW) and the Andromeda galaxy (M31) have been studied extensively 
over the last decades. More recent analyses of the Gaia data shed new light on the 
chemical- and structural properties, and on the phase-space distribution 
of the MW GC system.

Moreover, the visbility and ubiquity of GCs makes it possible to obtain integrated 
properties of GCs within the Local Group with reasonable certainty, and even of 
those that are located further away within the Virgo Supercluster.

The natal gas regions in which globular clusters form inherit key characteristics 
from their parent (proto-)galaxies. GC populations, in turn, will therefore retain 
a record of these properties and offer unique insight into the detailed chemical 
and dynamical evolution history of their host galaxies. In theory, this information 
should be readily available and easily observable in the low redshift Universe, given 
that GCs survive nearly a Hubble time of evolution within the violent galactic 
environments they live in. However, these long and complex evolution histories
themselves imposes their imprints onto the GCs observables. Thus, a prerequisite to 
infer galactic histories from studies of GC systems is to understand the 
subtleties of the GC formation and evolution itself.

The literature offers several formation scenerarios that are consistent with the 
data. One important constraint comes from bimodality in the colour distribution, 
which is indicative of a bimodality in the underlying metallicity distribution 
of GC systems. For example, GCs in the MW are typically split up in a metal-rich 
(red) and metal-poor (blue) subpopulation divided at [Fe/H]~$=-1$ 
\citep[e.g.][]{Harris2001}. These two subpopulations could be associated to the 
galactic disk, respectively to the stellar halo \citep[e.g.][]{1985ApJ...293..424Z}. 
The latter is supported by observed similarities between the spatial distribution
and chemical signature of the `blue' GCs and the Galactic stellar halo 
\citep{2008A&ARv..15..145H}. Moreover, relative age-estimates indicate that the 
metal-poor subpopulation may be $1.5$~Gyr younger than the metal-rich counterpart 
\citep{2005AJ....130..116D}, providing futher support that the GC population indeed
consists of two distinct classes.

People postulate that the frequent mergers that occur during hierarchical build-up 
of galaxies naturally produce (sub)populations of GCs from enriched gas on tight 
orbits, if the mass ratios and gas fractions of the mergers are sufficiently high.

Boylan-Kolchin: the blue population could form in high density regions along the 
cosmic filament before or during the collapse of the proto-galaxy itself.
This formation scenario would explain the presence of the oldest GCs with 
primordial metallicities in the (outer) haloes of galaxies as the GCs are
accreted over time. Moreover, the tidal fields experienced by GCs at (outer) halo
orbits is significantly lower than by GCs in the inner galaxy, thus such GCs
are expected to be long-lived.

In a recent study, Chiou et al. speculate that GCs may form in supersonically
induced gasseous objects at high redshifts. These objects are free of dark matter 
and populate a mass range consistent with the typical mass scale of GCs. 
Interestingly, the authors find present-day absolute visual magnitude and 
characteristic scales consistent with GCs in the Local group, based on a 
rudimentary star formation model.

An alternative paradigm is that GC formation does not rely on special conditions
at high redshifts. Rather, the same physics that governs the formation of young 
massive clusters (YMCs) in the Local Group can be applied to the high redshift
Universe. The observed differences between YMCs and GCs, in this scenario, arise
naturally as the result intrinsic GC evolution within galactic tidal fields over
a Hubble time. This interesting hypothesis is tested numerically by the E-MOSAICS
people.

\todo[inline]{Paragraph: narrow down to this work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The star formation model implemented in the Auriga simulations is capable of producing a suite/population of realistic Milky Way-like galaxies at redshift zero.
    \item Therefore the question naturally arises whether or not the Auriga simulations are also capable of faithfully producing a globular cluster population as observed in the Milky Way (or Andromeda).
    \item Globular cluster formation in cosmological zoom simulations is very interesting for two reasons. First of all, extragalactic observations typically show the integrated properties of globular clusters rather than that of the individual stars within the clusters. Moreover, the typical mass scale of globular clusters is comparable to the numerical (mass) resolution of cosmological zoom simulations. The detailed small scale physics that is at play for real world globular clusters appears in observations as the combined effect of the $10^{3-6}$ M\Sun, compared to a mass resolution of $10^{3-5}$ M\Sun for the Auriga simulations. Globular clusters can therefore serve as an ultimate test to the star formation model that is implemented in the numerical simulations. Secondly, cosmological zoom simulations provide an accurate recording of the full and detailed merger history of the simulated galaxy. This is important because theoretical paradigms for globular cluster formation in the literature know two distinct classes of GCs that are separated by their exact formation sites: an in-situ versus an accreted population. Cosmological zoom simulations uniquely allow for an investigation into globular cluster formation with particular focus on the in-situ and accreted populations.
\end{itemize}


\todo[inline]{Paragraph: Paper outline}
We summarise the relevant characteristics of the Auriga simulations in
section~\ref{sec:auriga}, followed by a summary of the observations of the
Milky Way (MW) globular cluster system (GCS) in section~\ref{sec:observations}
that we use to compare our simulations to in section~\ref{sec:results}. We
discuss our findings in section~\ref{sec:discussion} to come to our conclusions
in section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.


\section{The Auriga simulations}
\label{sec:auriga}
We use the Auriga simulations \citep[][hereafter G17]{2017MNRAS.467..179G}, a
suite of high-resolution cosmological zoom simulations of Milky Way-mass
selected initial conditions. The simulations are performed with the
state-of-the art code \textsc{arepo} \citep{2010MNRAS.401..791S,
2016MNRAS.455.1134P}, that solves the magnetohydrodynamical equations on a
moving mesh, and an elaborate galaxy formation model that produces realistic
spiral galaxies at redshift $z=0$.

The interstellar medium is modelled using a sub-grid approach which implements
the physical processes most relevant to galaxy formation and evolution.
This model was tailored to the \textsc{arepo} code and calibrated to reproduce
key observables of galaxies, such as the history of the cosmic star formation rate
density, the stellar mass to halo mass relation, and galaxy luminosity functions.

The sub-grid includes primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding
corrections. Reionization is completed at redshift six by a time-varying
spatially uniform UV background \citep{2009ApJ...703.1416F, 2013MNRAS.436.3031V}
The interstellar medium is described by an equation of state for a two-phase medium
in pressure equilibrium \citep{2003MNRAS.339..289S} with stochastic star formation
in thermally unstable gas with a density threshold of $n = 0.13 \text{cm}^{-3}$,
and consecutive stellar evolution is accounted for. Stars provide feedback by
stellar winds \citep{2014MNRAS.437.1750M, 2017MNRAS.467..179G}, and further
enrich the ISM with metals from SNIa, SNII, and AGB stars \citep{2013MNRAS.436.3031V}.
The formation of black holes is modelled which results in feedback from active
galactic nuclei \citep{2005MNRAS.361..776S, 2014MNRAS.437.1750M, 2017MNRAS.467..179G}.
Finally, the simulations follow the evolution of a magnetic field of $10^{-14}$
(comoving)~G seeded at $z = 127$ \citep{2013MNRAS.432..176P, 2014ApJ...783L..20P}.
See G17 for further details of the numerical setup as well as the galaxy formation
model.

The Auriga suite has a fiducial resolution level L4, accompanied by the lower
(higher) level L5 (L3) that is available for selected initial condition runs.
The baryonic mass resolution in order of increasing level is $m_b$~=~[$4 \times 10^5$,
$5 \times 10^4$, $6 \times 10^3$]~M\Sun \, with gravitational softening of
collissionless particles $\epsilon$~=~[$738, 369, 184$]~pc.

\section{Observational data}
\label{sec:observations}
We summarise relevant observations of the globular cluster system of the Milky
Way in Sec.~\ref{sec:milkyway}, and of Andromeda (M31) in Sec.~\ref{sec:andromeda}.

\subsection{Milky Way}
\label{sec:milkyway}
\citet[][2010 edition; hereafter H96e10]{1996AJ....112.1487H} provides a
catalogue\footnote{See \url{https://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/Fac_Harris/mwgc.dat}}
of the Milky Way globular cluster system that contains properties of
157 GCs. The authors initially estimated the size of the MW GCS to be 180~$\pm$~10,
thus, their catalogue to be $\sim$85\% complete. However, an additional 59 GCs
have since been discovered by various authors. The total confirmed number of GCs
in the MW adds up to 216 with new estimates now anticipating an additional thirty
GCs yet to be discovered \citep[e.g.][and references therein]{2018ApJ...863L..38R}.

\citet{2019AJ....157...12B} communicate the latest efforts to aggregate the
available data, presented in their CatClu catalog. Amongst 10978 star clusters
and alike objects in the Milky Way, the catalog contains 200 GCs and 94 GC
candidates. The CatClu catalog contains reference papers, positions, distances,
and total absolute V magnitude. Therefore we rely on the H96e10 dataset for all
other quantities, but we caution that the Harris catalogue is now believed to be (only) 53-72\% complete.

Specifically, the relevant data fields that we use from H96e10 are the
metallicity [Fe/H], the Galactic distance components $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ (in
kpc)\footnote{In a Sun-centered coordinate system: $X$ points toward Galactic
center, $Y$ in direction of Galactic rotation, and $Z$ toward the North Galactic
Pole. We calculate the galactocentric radius $R_{\text{GC}}=\sqrt{(X-R_\odot)^2
+ Y^2 + Z^2}$, assuming the solar radius $R_\odot=8$~kpc.}, and absolute
magnitude in the V-band $M_V$. We use the latter to calculate mass-estimates by
assuming $M_{V,\odot}=4.83$ and a mass to light ratio $M/L_V = 1.7$~M/L$_{\odot}$,
the mean for MW clusters \citep{2005ApJS..161..304M}.

\subsubsection{Age estimates}
We supplement H96e10 with age-estimates from isochrone fits to stars
near the main-sequence turnoff in 55 GCs \citep[][hereafter V13]{2013ApJ...775..134V}.
The mean value of the age-estimates in this data set is $11.9 \pm 0.1$~Gyr and
the dispersion is $0.8$~Gyr. Furthermore, only one of the 55 GC age-estimates is
below $10$~Gyr.

\subsection{Andromeda}
\label{sec:andromeda}
The fifth revision of the revised bologna catalogue (RBC~5, last updated
August, 2012) is the latest edition of three decades of systematically
collecting integrated properties of the globular cluster system of the
Andromeda galaxy \citep[][and references therein]{2004A&A...416..917G}. One
contribution to RBC~5 is the work by \citet[][hereafter C11]{2011AJ....141...61C},
subsequently updated by \citet[][hereafter CR16]{2016ApJ...824...42C}.

C11 and CR16 present a uniform set of spectroscopic observations calibrated
on the Milky Way GCS of the inner $1.6^\circ~(\sim21)$~kpc that
is believed to be 94\% complete. GCs in the outer stellar halo, up to
$R_{\text{proj}}\sim150$~kpc, are observed in the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological
Survey \citep[PAndAS, ][hereafter H14]{2014MNRAS.442.2165H}, but see also
\citet{2014MNRAS.442.2929V} and \citet{2019MNRAS.484.1756M}. H14 presents the
discovery of 59 new GCs and publishes updates to RBC~5. The work of H14 is
incorporated in the latest public release\footnote{Last revised 23 Sep 2015, see
\url{https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/oir/eg/m31clusters/M31_Hectospec.html}}
of the C11 dataset, further revised by CR16. It seems that CR16 is the most
recent aggregated dataset of M31's GCS that contains properties of interest
for our study as it contains GCs in the inner region and in the outer halo. The
relevant fields in the CR16 dataset that we use are the age, metallicity, and the
mass-estimate\footnote{The authors assumed $M/L_V = 2$ independent of [Fe/H]}.

% ``For M31 GC masses we combine the catalogues of Caldwell et al. (2011, using the

\subsubsection{Age estimates}
For M31 we find an age distribution with a mean value of 11.0$\pm 0.2$~Gyr and a
dispersion of $2.2$~Gyr. Furthermore, $24$ GCs have age-estimates below $10$~Gyr, and
the minimum age is $4.8$~Gyr.

We present a mass-weighted histogram of the age-estimates of the $55$ MW GCs in V13
and $85$ GCs in M31 for which age-estimates are available in CR16, see
Figure~\ref{fig:MW-M31-age}.

\subsection{Total GC mass in metallicity-radial space}
\label{sec:observations_FeHRgc}
We show the two-dimensional mass-weighted metallicity-radial distribution of the
MW (M31) GCS in the top (bottom) panel of Figure~\ref{fig:observations_FeHRgc}. Both
quantities are readily available in H96e10, but the galactocentric radius
of GCs in M31 is not available in CR16. Therefore we follow
\citet[][Sec.~4.1]{2019arXiv190111229W} to calculate the projected radius
$R_{\text{proj}}$ from the observed positions, adopting M31's central position
from the NASA Extragalactic Database\footnote{\url{https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/}}
$(\alpha_0, \, \delta_0) =
(0^{\text{h}}42^{\text{m}}44.35^{\text{s}}, \, +41^{\circ}16'08.63")$
and distance $D_{\text{M31}} = 778$~kpc (McConnachie et al. 2005; Conn  et  al. 2012).
We calculate $R_{\text{GC}}$ as `average deprojected distance`
$R_{\text{GC}} = R_{\text{proj}} \times (4/\pi)$.
We compare these observations to the Auriga simulations later on in
Sec.~\ref{sec:discussion_FeHRgc},

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
We define GC candidates in the Auriga simulations as all star particles older
than $10$~Gyr based on the age distribution of the MW GCS (Figure~\ref{fig:MW-M31-age}),
and following the analysis of \citet{2017MNRAS.465.3622R}.

Trough out our analysis we compare the distributions of three subsets of star 
particles: \emph{old stars} (age $>10$~Gyr, or GC candidates), \emph{old insitu} 
stars (defined as those bound to the most-massive halo/subhalo in the first
snapshot that the particle was recorded), and \emph{old accreted} star particles 
(those that have formed ex-situ and are bound to the most-massive halo/subhalo
at $z=0$). For comparison we also include the results for \emph{all stars} (when
no additional selection criterion is applied to the star particles). We consider 
the metallicity distribution in Sec.~\ref{sec:results_FeH}, the distribution of 
galactocentric radii in Sec.~\ref{sec:results_Rgc}, and the combination of both 
in Sec.~\ref{sec:results_FeHRgc}.


\subsection{Metallicity distribution}
\label{sec:results_FeH}
We investigate whether the star formation model implemented in Auriga produces 
metallicity distributions consistent with the MW (M31) GC system, and whether 
the subgrid generates sufficient total mass to account for the bound cluster 
formation efficiency and evolutionary mass loss.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{{FeH_mu_sigma}.png}
    \caption{
        First vs second central moment of the Auriga L4 metallicity distributions.
        Each dot represents one simulation for a given colour. The orange (blue) 
        [red] dots shows the values calculated using the old (old insitu) 
        [old accreted] star particles. Orange triangles indicate that all stars 
        were used. The purple (magenta) cross denotes our calculation using all 
        MW (M31) observations (i.e. asuming a unimodal distribution). The black 
        solid (open) dots indicate the literature values of a bimodal Gaussian 
        fit to the data \citep[values from][p. 38]{1998gcs..book.....A},
        showing the the metal-rich (metal-poor) component of the MW.
        \label{fig:FeH_mu_sigma}
    }
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:FeH_mu_sigma} shows the mean and standard deviation of the
[Fe/H] distribution of star particles in the Auriga L4 simulations. One dot 
of a given colour shows one particular simulation (thirty in total). The 
orange (blue) [red] dots represent the distributions of old (old insitu) 
[old accreted] star particles, and orange triangles indicate that all stars
were used. The mean metallicities of all GC candidates (orange dots) lie in the 
range $-0.95$ to $-0.4$, which is lower than when we include all star particles 
(orange triangles, centred around $\mu \sim 0$). Furthermore we find that the 
distributions of the accreted (insitu) GC candidates shift to slightly lower 
(higher) values and seem to be roughly centred around $\mu \sim -0.5$ ($-0.8$)
We find this trent that the distribution is more metal-poor (metal-rich)
when splitting the GC candidates into accreted (insitu) populations for the
majority of the Auriga simulations. The only exceptions are Au4-1 where this 
trent is reversed, and Au4-7 where all three (sub)populations have $\mu \sim -0.82$

The purple (magenta) cross shows the values calculated using all MW (M31) GC
observations (i.e. assuming a unimodal distribution). The black solid (open) dots
mark the literature values of a bimodal Gaussian fit to the MW data, indicating
the metal-rich (metal-poor) subpopulation. Overall we find that the Auriga 
simulations produce (sub)populations of GC candidates that are more metal-rich 
than the MW and M31 GC systems. The only exception is Au4-1 with $\mu \approx -1.51$
and $\sigma \approx 0.54$, close to the mean of the blue/metal-poor population
of the MW GCS. However, the insitu GC candidates in Au4-1 consists 30 times
less star particles than any of the other (sub)population. Finally, we find that
the populations of GC candidates that have formed insitu have mean values that 
are similar the that of the red/metal-rich subpopulation of Milky Way GCs.

(sub)populations of GC candidates in the Auriga simulations has a metallicity
distribution with sufficiently low

        age $>$~10~Gyr; orange solid). The latter sub set is further split up
        between stars that formed in-situ (blue solid), and those that were accreted
        (red solid). Shaded regions indicate the $1\sigma$ interval. The MW (M31)
        GCS is shown in purple (magenta). The middle (bottom) panel shows the

    }
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:FeH} shows the mass-weighted metallicity distribution of the
Auriga L4 haloes. Lines show the median value and the shaded regions indicate
the $1\sigma$ interval around it (i.e. scatter between runs with different initial
conditions which thus have unique merger histories). We notice again that
the peak metallicity shifts down from $0$ to $-0.5$ for old stars (orange solid)
compared to all stars (orange dotted) while the mass at the peak lowers by 
roughly one dex. The mass budget of the old stars is
dominated by the old insitu population (blue solid) below [Fe/H]=$-1$, and by
the old accreted stars (red solid) above this value. We show the MW (M31) GCS 
in purple (magenta) and we show the ratio of the simulated to the observed 
profiles in the middle (bottom) panel. This mass excess can be thought of as a
combination of the bound cluster formation efficiency and disruptive processes,
further discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:discussion_mass_excess}.

    }
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:Rgc_mu_sigma} shows the mean and standard deviation of the
radial distribution of star particles in all Auriga L4 simulations. We notice 
that the old insitu populations are much more centrally distributed, whereas
the old accreted component has a larger radial extent. Moreover, the dispersion
increases with increasing mean value of the radial distribution.

        \label{fig:Rgc}
    }
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:Rgc} shows the mass-weighted radial distribution of the
Auriga L4 haloes. We notice a subtle peak around $10$~kpc for all star
particles that is not present for the old star particles, indicating that the
stellar disc is no longer present when applying the latter selection criterion.
Furtermore, we find that the dominant contribution to the total mass in old
stars changes from those formed insitu to the accreted population around 
$10$~kpc. We further discuss our comparison between the simulations and the 
observations in Sec.~\ref{sec:discussion_Rgc}.



\subsection{Total mass in metallicity-radial space}
\label{sec:results_FeHRgc}

We investigate whether the Auriga simulations still produce sufficient mass in 
old star particles to be consistent with the MW (M31) GCS when two-dimensionally 
binned in both [Fe/H] and $R_\text{GC}$. We sum the total simulated mass in 
each bin and then divide it by the total mass in the MW (M31) GCS. We show this
mass excess in Figure~\ref{}, respectively Figure~\ref{}

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
\subsection{Metallicity distribution}
\label{sec:discussion_FeH}
\citet[][p. 234]{1998gcs..book.....A} and \citet[][p. 38]{Harris2001} describe
the bimodal [Fe/H] distribution of the MW GCS. The latter fits a double
Gaussian that peaks at [Fe/H] = $-1.59$ (metal-poor) and $-0.51$ (metal-rich)
with dispersions of $0.34$ and $0.23$. T
KMM mixture-modeling

Furthermore, 
We note that the scatter between different
Auriga haloes is much smaller than the difference between the MW and M31 GCSs.
We conclude that old star particles in the Auriga simulation suite as a whole
cannot be consistent with both the Milky Way and the Andromeda globular cluster
system.

We observe an increasing trend with increasing metallicity
for the Milky Way over the entire range of the data, while the M31 GCS shows
this increase only in the range [Fe/H]$>$-0.5 (although not for the \emph{old
accreted} component.


Furthermore we test the null hypothesis that the metallicity distribution of the
MW (M31) GCS and the \emph{old}, \emph{old insitu}, and \emph{old accreted} star
particles in the Auriga simulations are drawn from the same underlying
distribution. We calculate the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic for
all thirty Auriga level 4 haloes and reject the null hypothesis for every halo,
for every sub set of star particles at least at the 99.99\% confidence level.
In addition, the null hypothesis that the metallicity distributions of the MW
and M31 GCS are drawn from the same distribution is rejected at the 99.99997\%
confidence level.


\subsection{Radial distribution}
\label{sec:discussion_Rgc}

\todo[inline]{
    Harris: `Somewhat arbitrarily, I will take the region $r_p > 3$ kpc
    (containing 75 clusters) as the fiducial Milky Way sample. If we were to
    view the Milky Way at the same inclination angle to the disk as we see
    M31, this cutoff in projected distance would correspond roughly to the
    inner distance limits in the M31 halo sample.'
}


\subsection{Metallicity-radial space}
\label{sec:discussion_FeHRgc}
See Figure~\ref{fig:observations_FeHRgc} in Sec.~\ref{sec:observations_FeHRgc}.


\todo[inline]{
``The fraction of all star formation that occurs in bound stellar clusters (the cluster formation efficiency, hereafter CFE) follows by integration of these local clustering and survival properties over the full density spectrum of the ISM, and hence is set by galaxy-scale physics. We derive the CFE as a function of observable galaxy properties, and find that it increases with the gas surface density'' \citep{2012MNRAS.426.3008K}
}

\subsection{Age cut}
Although the age distribution of M31 Perhaps an age cut of 6~Gyr would would be more
appropriate for M31, see Figure~\ref{fig:MW-M31-age}.


\todo[inline]{
\citet{2016ApJ...824...42C} writes:
``there are two broad, well-established differences:
(1) the M31 GC system is more populous than the MW system, by a factor of
$\sim$2-3, and (2) it does not exhibit the same obvious bimodality in
metallicity \citep{2000AJ....119..727B, 2009A&A...508.1285G, 2011AJ....141...61C,
2013A&A...549A..60C}. Both of these aspects may be reflections of dramatic
differences discovered in these galaxies stellar halos, where the M31 halo
appears much more metal-enriched, with massive substructures suggesting a more
active satellite accretion history \citep[e.g.][]{2009Natur.461...66M}''
}

\subsection{From star particles to globular clusters}
\label{sec:discussion_mass_excess}
Star particles are not globular clusters. Many stars do form in clusters, but
not all clusters end up gravitationally bound. Star particles in the
Auriga simulations represent single-age stellar populations that have formed
at the same location within the galaxy. Therefore one could assume a model
for the star cluster formation efficiency $\Gamma$, which could be used to
`convert' star particles to bound star clusters e.g. Kruijssen (2012). This
model relies on the local birth properties of the star particles. However,
in our analysis we can retrieve the properties of the star particle in the
first snapshot it was recorded, but not the gas properties at times of birth.
Therefore we are unable to model the formation of star clusters in more detail.

Furthermore, we compare star particles to present-day globular clusters, thereby
ignoring the effects of (dynamical) disruption of globular clusters over nearly
a Hubble time. As shown by Pfeffer et al. (2018), a detailed model of the tidal
history of star clusters requires a temporal resolution of order mega year. For
the Auriga level 4 simulations we have 128 snapshots for the age of the Universe,
thus, a far too coarse temporal resolution for meaningful calculations.

Therefore we investigate the over-production of simulated mass in the metallicity
and radial bins and use the term `efficiency' to refer to the combined product
of bound cluster formation and globular cluster disruption. In Figure~\ref{fig:todo}
we show the efficiencies that we find when we compare the simulations to the
globular cluster systems of the Milky Way as well as that of Andromeda (M31).

\section{Scatter between individual Auriga haloes, and numerical convergence}

We check whether the properties of the Auriga globular cluster candidates
are well converged between the three different resolution levels used for the
Auriga simulations. Here we consider all three Auriga haloes for which simulation
runs were performed at all three resolution levels: Au6, Au16, and Au24. Here
we can investigate differences between individual haloes.
