% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
We investigate whether the galaxy formation model used for the Auriga simulations
can produce a realistic globular cluster population at redshift zero. We compare
properties of the simulated star particles in the Auriga haloes with catalogues
of observations of the Milky Way and Andromeda globular cluster populations available
in the literature. We find that the Auriga simulations do produce sufficient mass
at radii and metallicities that are typical for the MW GCS, although we observe
a varying mass-excess for the different $R_{\text{GC}}$-[Fe/H] bins. This implies
different values for the combined product of the bound cluster formation efficiency
and the globular cluster disruption rate. Furthermore we test whether any of the
Auriga galaxies has a metallicity and radial distribution that is consistent with
the MW (M31) GCS. For any one of the Auriga haloes we reject the null hypothesis that
the observed and simulated metallicities of GCs (GC candidates) are drawn from 
the same distribution at $\geq98.32$~\% confidence level, for the GCS of the 
Milky Way as well as that of the Andromeda galaxy. The same holds true for the 
distribution of galactocentric radius. Overall, the Auriga simulations produce 
old star particles with higher metallicities than the MW and M31 GCS and at 
larger radii. The formation efficiency would have to linearly decrease with 
increasing metallicity for the Auriga GC candidates to be consistent with the MW GCS.

\section{Introduction}
Globular clusters (GC)s are old, bright, ubiquitous, and various properties of
GC systems show correlations with their host galaxies. GC systems are believed to
retain information about the galactic (gas) conditions at times of formation,
thus, could offer unique insight into the (chemodynamical) evolution of their 
parent galaxies, if the formation and evolution of GCs- and GC systems themselves 
is adequately understood. However, despite decades of research (the extensive 
literature on GCs is summarised in several books and review articles, e.g.~\citealt{
1991ARA&A..29..543H, Harris2001, 2004Natur.427...31W, 2006ARA&A..44..193B, 
2012A&ARv..20...50G, 2014CQGra..31x4006K, 2018RSPSA.47470616F}), consensus on an 
exhaustive picture of the formation of GCs is yet to be reached.

The literature offers a wealth of formation scenarios. \citet{1968ApJ...154..891P}
and \citet{1984ApJ...277..470P} argue that GCs form as the earliest bound
structures in the Universe (i.e. prior to formation of the main galaxy), 
noting that the Jeans length and mass shortly after recombination is consistent
with typical GC masses and sizes. \citet{2005MNRAS.364..367D} and \citet{
2009ApJ...706L.192B} argue that (the blue subpopulations of) GCs form in biased 
dark matter halos at high redshift. Other recent hypotheses of GC formation prior 
to collapse of the proto-galaxy include formation in colliding supershells 
\citep{2017Ap&SS.362..183R}, in supersonically induced gaseous objects
\citep{2019arXiv190408941C}, or in high-speed collisions of dark matter subhaloes
\citep{2019arXiv190508951M}. \citet{2017MNRAS.472.3120B} suggests
that (the blue subpopulation of) GCs could form in high density regions along
the cosmic filament before or during collapse.

Other models also date GCs formation during formation of the proto-galaxy itself,
for example as a result of thermal instabilities in hot gas-rich haloes 
(\citealt{1985ApJ...298...18F}, also see the discussions in \citealt{
1990ApJ...363..488K}). Alternative formation trigggers are also explored, such as 
(other causes of) shock compression, or cloud-cloud colissions \citep[e.g.][]{
1980glcl.conf..301G, 1992ApJ...400..265M, 1994ApJ...429..177H, 1995ApJ...442..618V,
1996ASPC...92..241L, 2001ApJ...560..592C}. 

Yet another hypothesis is that star cluster formation is triggered by (major) 
gas-rich (spiral) galaxy mergers \citep{1987nngp.proc...18S, 1992ApJ...384...50A},
which is naturally expected within the framework of hierarchical assembly. One
testable prediction of this scenario is the formation of young clusters in
interacting and merging galaxies, which has been observed and are found to show 
remarkable similarities with globulars in the Milky Way \citep[e.g.][]{
1995AJ....109..960W, 1996AJ....112..416H, 1999AJ....118..752Z, 1999AJ....118.1551W}.
Moreover, modelling efforts of this framework yield GC (sub)populations consistent 
with various observables \citep[e.g.][]{2010ApJ...718.1266M, 2018MNRAS.480.2343C}, 
and the recent numerical simulation of an isolated dwarf-dwarf merger executed at 
very high resolution (baryonic mass $m_b \sim$~4M\Sun; softening $\epsilon = 0.1$) 
produce star clusters that could be globular progenitors \citep{
2019arXiv190509840L}.

As for the formation timeline, the scenarios (and flavours thereof) of \citet{
1985ApJ...298...18F} and \citet{1992ApJ...384...50A} are intertwined because
accretion and mergers continuously occurs trough out hierarchical build-up of
galaxies. Various (other) hierarchical formation channels thus combine different
aspects of the aforementioned paradigms, such as GC formation in (small) galactic
disks before they are accreted onto an assembling galaxy \citep[e.g.][]{
2000ApJ...533..869C, 2002ApJ...567..853C, 2002MNRAS.333..383B, 2003egcs.conf..224G}. 
We refer to \citet{2001astro.ph..8034G} for a scoreboard of the aforementioned 
paradigms compared to observations of the Milky Way globular cluster system.

An idea that has recently been studied in detail is the hypothesis that the physical 
processes responsible for the formation of young massive clusters \citep[YMCs, 
see][for a review]{2010ARA&A..48..431P}, as observable in detail in the local 
Universe in great
, also governs GC formation at high redshifts. In this framework, differences
between both classes of objects are caused by nearly a Hubble time of (dynamical)
evolution \citep[e.g.][]{1987degc.book.....S}. This picture is based on observed 
similarities between YMCs and GCs \citep[e.g.][]{1992AJ....103..691H,1999AJ....118.1551W}
and strengthened by observations of gravitationally lensed objects at high redshifts
($z = 2-6)$. These sources have properties reminiscent of (local) YMCs and may be
GC progenitors at times of formation \citep{2017MNRAS.467.4304V,2017ApJ...843L..21J}.
The modelling work by \citet{2011MNRAS.414.1339K,2012MNRAS.421.1927K,2015MNRAS.454.1658K} 
is now incorporated into cosmological zoom simulations and shows promising results
\citep{2018MNRAS.475.4309P,2019MNRAS.486.3134K}.

Simulation resolutions have reached the mass range populated by GCs, and the
gravitational force softening can be as low several parsec. A number of groups 
can thus incorporate formation of (globular) star clusters into their 
high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations. \citet{2016ApJ...831..204R} 
run parsec scale simulations of the high-redshift universe 
prior to reionization (the simulations stop at $z=9$), \citet{2017ApJ...834...69L} 
implement a new subgrid model for star (cluster) formation and run simulations 
that reach $z=3.3$, and the run of \citet{2017MNRAS.465.3622R} reaches $z=0.5$. 
\citet{2018MNRAS.474.4232K} find that mergers can push gas to high density that
quickly forms clustered stars that end up tightly bound by the end of the 
simulation. A somewhat different approach couples semi-analytical models to DM-only
simulations \citep{2010ApJ...718.1266M,2014ApJ...796...10L,2018MNRAS.480.2343C,
2019MNRAS.486..331C,2019arXiv190505199C}, as is done in the work by 
\citet{2019MNRAS.482.4528E}.

In this work we use state of the art simulations that produce realistic spiral 
galaxies at redshift zero for which several global properties are consistent with 
the observations. The simulations yield realistic Milky Way analogues, and real
galaxies host globular cluster systems. The question thus naturally arises whether 
the star formation histories of the simulations (also) give rise to a GC system 
similar to the Milky Way and/or Andromeda globular cluster systems. In particular, 
we use the Auriga suite of cosmological zoom simulations 
(\citealt{2017MNRAS.467..179G}, and described in Sec.~\ref{sec:auriga}) to
investigate whether the star formation model implemented produces metallicity, 
radial, and metallicity-radial distributions that are consistent with the MW 
and/or M31 GC systems, and whether the model produces enough stellar mass with
the right properties to allow for formation efficiencies lower than unity and
the expected (dynamical) mass loss over the cluster lifetime (not modelled 
explicitly in this study). 

The plan of the paper is as follows. We summarise the relevant characteristics 
of the Auriga simulations in section~\ref{sec:auriga}, followed by a summary of 
the observations of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda globular cluster system (GCS)
in section~\ref{sec:observations} that we use to compare our simulations to in
section~\ref{sec:results}. We discuss our findings in section~\ref{sec:discussion}
to come to our conclusions in section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.


\section{The Auriga simulations}
\label{sec:auriga}
We use the Auriga simulations \citep[][hereafter G17]{2017MNRAS.467..179G}, a
suite of high-resolution cosmological zoom simulations of Milky Way-mass
selected initial conditions. The simulations are performed with the \textsc{arepo} 
\citep{2010MNRAS.401..791S, 2016MNRAS.455.1134P} code that solves the 
magnetohydrodynamical equations on a moving mesh. The galaxy formation model 
produces realistic spiral galaxies at redshift $z=0$.

The interstellar medium is modelled using a sub-grid approach which implements
the physical processes most relevant to galaxy formation and evolution.
This model was tailored to the \textsc{arepo} code and calibrated to reproduce
key observables of galaxies, such as the history of the cosmic star formation rate
density, the stellar mass to halo mass relation, and galaxy luminosity functions.

The sub-grid includes primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding
corrections. Reionization is completed at redshift six by a time-varying
spatially uniform UV background \citep{2009ApJ...703.1416F, 2013MNRAS.436.3031V}
The interstellar medium is described by an equation of state for a two-phase medium
in pressure equilibrium \citep{2003MNRAS.339..289S} with stochastic star formation
in thermally unstable gas with a density threshold of $n = 0.13 \text{cm}^{-3}$,
and consecutive stellar evolution is accounted for. Stars provide feedback by
stellar winds \citep{2014MNRAS.437.1750M, 2017MNRAS.467..179G}, and further
enrich the ISM with metals from SNIa, SNII, and AGB stars \citep{2013MNRAS.436.3031V}.
The formation of black holes is modelled which results in feedback from active
galactic nuclei \citep{2005MNRAS.361..776S, 2014MNRAS.437.1750M, 2017MNRAS.467..179G}.
Finally, the simulations follow the evolution of a magnetic field of $10^{-14}$
(comoving)~G seeded at $z = 127$ \citep{2013MNRAS.432..176P, 2014ApJ...783L..20P}.
See G17 for further details of the numerical setup as well as the galaxy formation
model.

The Auriga suite has a fiducial resolution level L4, accompanied by the lower
(higher) level L5 (L3) that is available for selected initial condition runs.
The baryonic mass resolution in order of increasing level is $m_b$~=~[$4 \times 10^5$,
$5 \times 10^4$, $6 \times 10^3$]~M\Sun \, with gravitational softening of
collissionless particles $\epsilon$~=~[$738, 369, 184$]~pc. The mass resolution
of the Auriga simulations is thus close to the characteristic peak mass of the
lognormal GC mass distribution of $10^{5}$~M\Sun \citep{1991ARA&A..29..543H},
although the gravitational softening is two orders of magnitudes larger than
typical GC radii. High-density gaseous regions are thus not expected to produce
surviving stellar clumps with masses and radii consistent with GCs because
such objects would numerically disperse, even in the highest-resolution runs.
On the other hand, we can investigate (statistical) properties of age-selected
GC candidates because each star particle represents a single stellar population
with a total mass that could be consistent with one globular cluster. This means
that their formation sites and that of a real-world GC may be consistent.

\section{Observational data}
\label{sec:observations}
We describe the observations of the MW GCS in Sec.~\ref{sec:milkyway},
and of the Andromeda (M31) GCS in Sec.~\ref{sec:andromeda}


\subsection{Milky Way}
\label{sec:milkyway}
\citet[][2010 edition; hereafter H96e10]{1996AJ....112.1487H} provides a
catalogue\footnote{See \url{https://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/Fac_Harris/mwgc.dat}}
of the Milky Way globular cluster system that contains properties of
157 GCs. The authors initially estimated the size of the MW GCS to be 180~$\pm$~10,
thus, their catalogue to be ${\sim}$85\% complete. However, an additional 59 GCs
are claimed to have been discovered by various authors. The total number of GCs
in the MW might add up to 216 with recent estimates now anticipating an additional 
thirty GCs yet to be discovered \citep[e.g.][and references therein]{2018ApJ...863L..38R}.
We still use data from the Harris catalogue, but caution that it may (only) be
53-72\% complete. Specifically, the relevant data fields that we use from H96e10
are the metallicity [Fe/H], the Galactic distance components $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ (in
kpc)\footnote{In a Sun-centered coordinate system: $X$ points toward Galactic
center, $Y$ in direction of Galactic rotation, and $Z$ toward the North Galactic
Pole. We calculate the galactocentric radius $R_{\text{GC}}=\sqrt{(X-R_\odot)^2
+ Y^2 + Z^2}$, assuming the solar radius $R_\odot=8$~kpc.}, and absolute
magnitude in the V-band $M_V$. We use the latter to calculate mass-estimates by
assuming $M_{V,\odot}=4.83$ and a mass to light ratio $M/L_V = 1.7$~M/L$_{\odot}$,
the mean for MW clusters \citep{2005ApJS..161..304M}. We supplement the catalogue
with age-estimates from isochrone fits to stars near the main-sequence turnoff 
in 55 GCs \citep[][hereafter V13]{2013ApJ...775..134V}.

% \citet{2019AJ....157...12B} communicate the latest efforts to aggregate the
% available data, presented in their CatClu catalog. Amongst 10978 star clusters
% and alike objects in the Milky Way, the catalog contains 200 GCs and 94 GC
% candidates. The CatClu catalog contains reference papers, positions, distances,
% and total absolute V magnitude. Therefore we rely on the H96e10 dataset for all
% other quantities, but

\subsection{Andromeda}
\label{sec:andromeda}
The fifth revision of the revised bologna catalogue (RBC~5, last updated
August, 2012) is the latest edition of three decades of systematically
collecting integrated properties of the globular cluster system of the
Andromeda galaxy \citep[][and references therein]{2004A&A...416..917G}. One
contribution to RBC~5 is the work by \citet[][hereafter C11]{2011AJ....141...61C},
subsequently updated by \citet[][hereafter CR16]{2016ApJ...824...42C}.

C11 and CR16 present a uniform set of spectroscopic observations calibrated
on the Milky Way GCS of the inner $1.6^\circ~({\sim}21)$~kpc that
is believed to be 94\% complete. GCs in the outer stellar halo, up to
$R_{\text{proj}}\sim150$~kpc, are observed in the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological
Survey \citep[PAndAS, ][hereafter H14]{2014MNRAS.442.2165H}, but see also
\citet{2014MNRAS.442.2929V} and \citet{2019MNRAS.484.1756M}. H14 presents the
discovery of 59 new GCs and publishes updates to RBC~5. The work of H14 is
incorporated in the latest public release\footnote{Last revised 23 Sep 2015, see
\url{https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/oir/eg/m31clusters/M31_Hectospec.html}}
of the C11 dataset, further revised by CR16. It seems that CR16 is the most
recent aggregated dataset of M31's GCS that contains properties of interest
for our study as it contains GCs in the inner region and in the outer halo. The
relevant fields in the CR16 dataset that we use are the age, metallicity, and the
mass-estimate\footnote{The authors assumed $M/L_V = 2$ independent of [Fe/H]}.

\subsection{Age-estimates}
Figure~\ref{fig:MW-M31-age} shows a histogram of the age-estimates of the $55$
MW GCs in V13 and $88$ GCs in M31 for which age-estimates are available in CR16.
The mean age of the MW GCs in this data set is $11.9 \pm 0.1$~Gyr and the 
dispersion is $0.8$~Gyr. Furthermore, only one of the 55 GC age-estimates is
below $10$~Gyr. The M31 GCS has a mean age of $11.0 \pm 0.2$~Gyr with a dispersion 
of $2.2$~Gyr, and $24$ GCs have age-estimates below $10$~Gyr with a minimum age 
of $4.8$~Gyr. The Milky Way appears to host a globular cluster system that is
somewhat older than the Andromeda galaxy, although we caution that both data 
sets are incomplete and the age measurements have large uncertainties (of $1-2$~Gyr)

        \label{fig:MW-M31-age}
    }
\end{figure}

\subsection{Total GC mass in metallicity-radial space}
\label{sec:observations_FeHRgc}
We show the two-dimensional mass-weighted metallicity-radial distribution of the
MW (M31) GCS in the top (bottom) panel of Figure~\ref{fig:observations_FeHRgc}. Both
quantities are readily available in H96e10 (assuming $R_{\odot}=8.0$~kpc), but
the galactocentric radius of GCs in M31 is not available in CR16. Therefore we
follow \citet[][Sec.~4.1]{2019arXiv190111229W} to calculate the projected radius
$R_{\text{proj}}$ from the observed positions, adopting M31's central position
from the NASA Extragalactic Database\footnote{\url{https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/}}
$(\alpha_0, \, \delta_0) =
(0^{\text{h}}42^{\text{m}}44.35^{\text{s}}, \, +41^{\circ}16'08.63")$
and distance $D_{\text{M31}} = 780$~kpc \citep{2005MNRAS.356..979M,2012ApJ...758...11C}
We calculate $R_{\text{GC}}$ as `average deprojected distance`
$R_{\text{GC}} = R_{\text{proj}} \times (4/\pi)$. The observations indicate that
no GCs with high metallicities are to be expected at large radii (the three bins
in the upper right corner, both for MW and M31), and relatively few GCs at large
radii in general ($R_{\text{GC}} > 30$~kpc; right column: $11$ GCs or 7.3\% in
the MW and $17$ or 4.6\% in M31). We compare these observations to the Auriga
simulations later on in Sec.~\ref{sec:results_FeHRgc}.

\end{figure}


\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
We define GC candidates in the Auriga simulations as all star particles older
than $10$~Gyr based on the age distribution of the MW GCS (Figure~\ref{fig:MW-M31-age}),
and following the analysis of \citet{2017MNRAS.465.3622R}.

Trough out our analysis we compare the distributions of three subsets of star
particles: \emph{old stars} (age $>10$~Gyr, or GC candidates), \emph{old insitu}
stars (defined as those bound to the most-massive halo/subhalo in the first
snapshot that the particle was recorded), and \emph{old accreted} star particles
(those that have formed ex-situ and are bound to the most-massive halo/subhalo
at $z=0$). For comparison we also include the results for \emph{all stars} (when
no additional selection criterion is applied to the star particles). We consider
the metallicity distribution in Sec.~\ref{sec:results_FeH}, the distribution of
galactocentric radii in Sec.~\ref{sec:results_Rgc}, and the combination of both
in Sec.~\ref{sec:results_FeHRgc}.


\subsection{Metallicity distribution}
\label{sec:results_FeH}
We investigate whether the star formation model implemented in Auriga produces
metallicity distributions consistent with the MW and M31 GC systems, and whether
the subgrid generates sufficient total mass at metallicities typical for the
MW and M31 GCS's. To visually inspect the former we show the normalized metallicity 
distribution of three specific Auriga galaxies in Figure~\ref{fig:Au4-10and21_FeH}
in comparison to the MW and M31 [Fe/H] distributions.

We select \mbox{Au4-10}\footnote{The nomenclature is `Au' for Auriga, followed by the
resolution level (4) and halo number (10, indicating which set of initial
conditions was used the run).}, \mbox{Au4-21}, and \mbox{Au4-4} to show the
distributions of three individual simulation runs that we consider representative
for specific behaviour, and to highlight that different runs could give rise to 
different distributions. We plot the age-selected GC candidates in green, those
that are accreted in red, and the insitu subpopulation in blue. The top 
half of the left figure shows the MW (M31) GC system in purple (magenta), where 
we overplot a double Gaussian for the MW GCS (the purple dashed lines) by 
adopting literature values of the mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ of 
the metal-rich and metal-poor subpopulations \citep[][p. 38]{Harris2001}.

We find that the age cut, on average, lowers the mean metallicity from $0.0$ to
$-0.6$. Furthermore, the old accreted stars generally have lower mean metallicities
than the old insitu stars with differences of roughly ${\sim}0.3$ for the majority 
of the simulation runs. This behaviour can be seen in \mbox{Au4-21}, while a 
slightly larger difference of ${\sim}0.5$ dex is seen for \mbox{Au4-10} (as plotted), 
\mbox{Au4-16}, \mbox{Au4-17}, \mbox{Au4-18} and \mbox{Au4-22}. However, this trend 
is reversed for \mbox{Au4-1} and \mbox{Au4-4} for which the old insitu population 
has a lower mean metallicity instead. We caution that \mbox{Au4-1} is undergoing
a major merger at redshift zero and note that we find $\mu = -1.51 \, ({-0.74})$ 
for the old insitu (accreted) although the former consists of only $1019$ 
particles ($1.3$\% of all GC candidates, and with a total mass of 5e7 M\Sun). 
For \mbox{Au4-4}, ${10.8}$\% of the GC candidates is classified as insitu (compared 
to insitu fractions of ${40-80}$\% for other haloes). Overall we find that the 
simulations produce (sub)populations of GC candidates that are
more metal-rich than the MW and M31 GC systems. Moreover, none of the simulations
has a population of GC candidates with a bimodal metallicity distribution
(the green curves).

        \label{fig:FeH_mu_sigma}
    }
\end{figure}

We show the mean metallicity and standard deviation of all thirty Auriga L4 haloes
in Figure~\ref{fig:FeH_mu_sigma} to show the behaviour for the full set of Auriga
galaxies. The green crosses are to be compared to the purple (magenta) cross, 
which shows the mean value of all MW (M31) GCs. In addition, we show the metal-rich 
(metal-poor) population of the MW GCS using a solid (open) dot. We caution that
these literature values result from individual Gaussian fits to sub sets of the 
observational data cut at [Fe/H]~$= -1$. We do not include corresponding data 
points calculated using such an artificial cut for the simulated star particles.
Having said that, we do find it interesting that the mean metallicities of the 
old insitu populations appear roughly consistent with that of the metal-rich 
population of the MW although the simulations show larger dispersions. The latter 
could simply be caused by the hard separation of the data into two groups, which 
means the range is smaller and the resulting dispersion could be lower. With 
regard to the M31 GCS, we are uncertain whether definitive consensus is reached
concerning uni- bi- or trimodality in the [Fe/H] distribution, but CR16 argues 
that the data, after removal of younger objects due to improved age classification, 
hints at three populations separated at [Fe/H]~$>-0.4$ and [Fe/H]~$ < 1.5$. None 
of the Auriga sub sets has a mean value that offers much hope that the simulated 
distribution is consistent with the lowest metallicity group in the M31 GCS. This 
is also true for the metal-poor population of the MW with a mean value of $-1.6$.
The main take-away from this plot, again, is that all Auriga L4 galaxies have
metallicity distributions with (much) larger mean values than what is observed
for the MW and M31 GCS, and that we systematiclly find lower mean metallicities
for the accreted GC candidates than for those that have formed in situ.

Finally, we test the null hypothesis that MW (M31) and the GC candidates (all, insitu, and
accreted) are drawn from the same underlying distribution by calculating the KS
test statistic (i.e. six KS tests per simulation). We reject $H_0$ at the 100.00~\%
confidence level for virtually all subsets of all simulations, both for MW and M31,
except when comparing the old accreted stars of \mbox{Au4-10} to the MW GCS. In this
case we still reject $H_0$ with, but with $\leq 98.68$~\% confidence. When comparing
to the M31 GCS, the `best' matches are the old accreted subpopulations of \mbox{Au4-13},
\mbox{Au4-15}, and \mbox{Au4-17} ($H_0$ rejected with $\leq$ 99.82~\% confidence, 99.95~\%,
and 98.32~\%). Here we find that the cumulative distributions are more or less
similar up to [Fe/H]~$-0.5$, above which the simulations yield higher number
counts which drives the KS test statistic over the critical values. This affirms
our finding that the simulations produce GC candidates that are more metal-rich
than the MW (M31) GCS. The main reasons that $H_0$ is rejected with such
high confidence are under-production of old stars with [Fe/H]~$\leq$~-1.5,
and over-production of stars with [Fe/H]$\geq$~-0.5.

        simulations. We show the median value of all Auriga haloes for all
        stars (green dotted) and globular cluster candidates (i.e. stars with
        age $>$~10~Gyr; green solid). The latter sub set is further split up
        between stars that formed in-situ (blue solid), and those that were accreted
        (red solid). Shaded regions indicate the $1\sigma$ interval. The MW (M31)
        GCS is shown in purple (magenta). The middle (bottom) panel shows the

        \label{fig:FeH}
    }
\end{figure}
We now turn to the second goal, which is to see whether sufficient total mass in 
GC candidates produced by the Auriga simulations. To answer this question we plot
a mass-weighted metallicity distribution in Figure~\ref{fig:FeH}. We show the 
median (coloured lines) for all thirty Auriga L4 haloes with the $1\sigma$ 
interval around it (shaded regions, which shows the scatter between runs that 
have different initial conditions, thus, have unique merger histories). We chose 
to aggregate the data to indicate general trends that we find when the GC candidates 
are split up according to birth location, rather than selecting typical examples 
of individual (simulated) galaxies. Once again we notice that the peak metallicity 
shifts down from $0$ to $-0.6$ for old stars (green solid) compared to all stars 
(green dotted), and we learn that the mass at the peak lowers by roughly one dex. 
The mass budget of the old stars is dominated by the old insitu population (blue 
solid) below [Fe/H]~=~$-1$, and by the old accreted stars (red solid) above this 
value. We show the MW (M31) GCS in purple (magenta) and we show the ratio of the 
simulated to the observed profiles in the middle (bottom) panel. This mass excess 
can be thought of the `mass budget' that the Auriga GC candidates can `afford to 
lose' due to a combination of smaller than unity bound cluster formation 
efficiencies combined with a Hubble time of dynamical evolution, while still 
producing a GC system with sufficient mass to be consistent with the MW (M31) GCS. 
The cluster formation efficiency would have to linearly decrease with decreasing 
metallicity for Auriga GC candidates to produce a population of GC candidates 
that is consistent with the MW. For the GC candidates in M31 we find a constant 
mass excess up to $-0.9$, above which the simulations produce a higher mass excess 
with increasing metallicity. If dynamical evolution is not expected to more 
efficiently disrupt GCs of higher metallicity, then we would find that the 
efficiency to form bound star clusters would have to decrease with increasing 
metallicity.

\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:Rgc_mu_sigma} shows the mean and standard deviation of the
radial distribution of star particles in all Auriga L4 simulations. We notice
that the old insitu populations are much more centrally distributed, whereas
the old accreted component has a larger radial extent. Moreover, the dispersion
increases with increasing mean value of the radial distribution as may be expected
for a non-negative quantity.

        \label{fig:Rgc}
    }
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:Rgc} shows the mass-weighted radial distribution of the
Auriga L4 haloes. We notice a subtle peak around $10$~kpc for all star
particles that is not present for the GC candidates, indicating that the
stellar disc is no longer present when applying the latter selection criterion.
Furthermore, we find that the dominant contribution to the total mass in GC
candidates changes from those formed insitu to the accreted population around
$10$~kpc. Again we show the mass excess of the simulations compared to the Milky
Way and Andromeda GCS. We find a decreasing mass excess with increasing radius
in the range $0.2$ to ${\sim}5$ kpc, followed by an increase attributed
to the accreted subpopulation. We further investigate a breakdown of the total mass
in Auriga GC candidates into bins of both metallicity and radius in the following
section.

\subsection{Total mass in metallicity-radial space}
\label{sec:results_FeHRgc}

We investigate whether the Auriga simulations still produce sufficient mass when
the GC candidates are two-dimensionally binned in [Fe/H] and $R_\text{GC}$. First
we sum the total simulated mass in each bin (for an individual Auriga simulation),
then we calculate the median over all thirty Auriga L4 haloes (in each bin, see
Figure~\ref{fig:Au-FeHRgc} which can be compared to
Figure~\ref{fig:observations_FeHRgc}). Finally, we divide these value by the total
mass in the MW (M31) GCS to obtain the median mass excess produced by the star
formation model implemented in the Auriga simulations. See the top (bottom) panel
of Figure~\ref{fig:Au-FeHRgc-ratio} for mass excess with respect to the MW (M31) GCS.

\section{Discussion}
% ``The Auriga Stellar Haloes: Connecting stellar population properties with
% accretion and merging history'' \citet{2018arXiv180407798M}

\label{sec:discussion}
\subsection{Metallicity distribution}
\label{sec:discussion_FeH}
Globular clusters are ${\sim}0.5$ dex more metal-poor than spheroid stars observed 
at the same radius for almost all galaxies \citep{1991ARA&A..29..543H}. Our 
selection function (age cut) does lower the mean metallicity by $0.5$ dex, but
we still find that the metallicity distributions of GC candidates in the Auriga
simulations are more metal-rich than the MW (M31) GCS. Although the (old) star
particles represent single stellar populations with a mass (resolution) consistent 
with that of GCs, they are in fact statistical tracers of the stellar population 
of the galaxy as a whole. Therefore only a (small) fraction of the star particles 
may represent plausible formation sites of GCs, whereas the majority represents 
(halo) field stars - the disk component effectively falls outside our selection 
of star particles due to the age cut. 

In general, the colour (metallicity) distribution of most GC systems is bimodal 
with typical separating value [Fe/H]$\sim -1$ \citep{1985ApJ...293..424Z,
1999AJ....118.1526G,2001AJ....121.2974L,2006ApJ...639...95P}. Indeed, 
\citet[][p. 234]{1998gcs..book.....A} and \citet[][p. 38]{Harris2001} find that
the MW GCS has a bimodality [Fe/H] distribution: the latter fit a double Gaussian 
which peaks at [Fe/H] = $-1.59$ (metal-poor) and $-0.51$ (metal-rich) and 
dispersions of $0.34$ and $0.23$. Observations of GCs in M31, however, may be
best split into three distinct metallicity groups, one found at small radii with 
[Fe/H] $>-0.4$, one intermediate [Fe/H] group, and a dominant (metal-poor) group 
with [Fe/H] $< -1.5$ \citep{2016ApJ...824...42C}. The numerical simulation of
\citet{2017MNRAS.465.3622R} does yield a bimodal metallicity distribution where
the metal-poor population is dominated by accreted star particles and the metal-rich
population by insitu stars. 

We find that none of the Auriga simulations produces a bimodal 
metallicity distribution for age-selected GC candidates. Interestingly, the 
cross-over point above (below) which the mass-weighted metallicity distribution
of GC candidates is dominated by those that have formed insitu (were accreted) 
does coincide with the separation between the metal-rich and metal-poor populations 
of GC systems at [Fe/H]~=~$-1$. Moreover, we do find that the mean metallicity
shifts when we split the GC candidates up according to birth location (accreted
or in-situ). In particular, the mean values of the old insitu GC candidates are 
roughly consistent with the metal-rich MW GCs. However, we also notice that a 
substantial number of simulations has similar mean values for all GC candidates, 
and the simulated insitu GC candidates have larger dispersions than the metal-rich 
GCs. Moreover, the offset between the mean of the metal-rich and metal-poor 
populations in the MW is $1$ dex, a factor $2-3$ larger than the offset that we 
find between the insitu and accreted populations. The Auriga simulations therefore
do not support the view that the metal-poor GCs could have formed in satellites
that have later been accreted whereas the metal-rich GC subpopulation has formed
insitu. With this statement, however, we do caution that \citet{2019MNRAS.486.3134K} 
suggests to reserve the `ex situ' classification for accretion after $z=2$, when
the central galaxy has formed and accretion unambigously contributes to the
radially extended halo GC population. In fact, our classification appears flawed
in Au4-1.

Finally, we note that \citet{2006ARA&A..44..193B} compares the number of metal-poor 
GCs to the stellar halo mass and find\footnote{the quantity $T$ is the number of 
GCs per $10^9$ M\Sun \, of galaxy stellar mass} $T^n_{\text{blue}} \sim 100$, 
while the number of metal-rich GCs compared to the bulge mass yields 
$T^n_{\text{red}} \sim 5$, and therefore conclude that the formation efficiency
of metal-poor GCs is twenty times higher than the metal-rich GCs with respect to 
field stars. We find that gradual linear increase in formation efficiency of GCs
with respect to field stars would be required with decreasing metallicity for
the GC candidates in the Auriga simulations to yield sufficient total mass to
be consistent with the Milky Way GCS.

\subsection{Radial distribution}
\label{sec:discussion_Rgc}
The M31 GCS has a factor 2-3 more GCs at large radii compared to the MW GCS,
which may indicate that M31 has a richer merger history than the MW 
\citep{2016ApJ...824...42C}. In the Auriga simulations we find that the GC 
candidates at radii larger than ${\sim}20$~kpc are indeed dominated by accreted
star particles. However, we select star particles that are bound to the main 
halo and main subhalo, which means that we include particles up to the virial 
radius $R_{200}$. The Auriga simulations have no problem populating the stellar 
halo up to the virial radius, even with our additional age cut. On the other hand, 
the MW and M31 have fewer GCs at large radii. We expect tidal disruption to be
less efficient at larger radii, thus, the formation efficiencies of the accreted 
GC candidates would have to be lower. Our classification as GC candidates could, 
for example, be improved by selecting a number of globular clusters based on the 
$M_{vir}-N_{\text{GC}}$ correlation found by \citet{2019arXiv190100900B}, and 
taking a virial mass below which none of the star particles is treated as GC candidate.

% \todo[inline]{
%     Harris: `Somewhat arbitrarily, I will take the region $r_p > 3$ kpc
%     (containing 75 clusters) as the fiducial Milky Way sample. If we were to
%     view the Milky Way at the same inclination angle to the disk as we see
%     M31, this cutoff in projected distance would correspond roughly to the
%     inner distance limits in the M31 halo sample.'
% }

\subsection{Star particles are not globular clusters}
\label{sec:discussion_mass_excess}
% A major improvement to our classification of star particles as GC candidates
% could be made by explicitly taking into the formation efficiency of bound star
% clusters \citep{2012MNRAS.426.3008K}, which depends on the local ISM properties
% (density, pressure, sound speed). However, the only information available in
% post-processing are the properties of the star particles recorded in the first
% snapshot after formation. We could attempt to obtain the properties of the nearest
% gas cell, but this would have to be limited to a very narrow time window between
% the time of formation and the time of the snapshot because the star particle could
% otherwise be in a completely different location than where it was born initially.
% Moreover, even if the birth time and snapshot time would coincide, it would not
% be obvious that the gas cell will yield the correct quantities as the formation
% of the star itself alters the properties of the gas. We therefore did not further
% attempt a more sophisticated modeling of the cluster formation efficiency in
% post-processing.
% 
% Furthermore, we compare star particles to present-day globular clusters, thereby
% ignoring the effects of (dynamical) disruption of globular clusters over nearly
% a Hubble time. As shown by \citep{2018MNRAS.475.4309P}, a detailed model of the tidal
% history of star clusters requires a temporal resolution of order mega year. For
% the Auriga L4 simulations we have a total of 128 snapshots available over the
% age of the Universe, thus, far too coarse temporal resolution for meaningful
% calculations of tidal disruption along the orbit of our GC candidates. Therefore
% we can only combine these two shortcomings of our analysis into the `mass excess',
% which includes the cluster formation efficiency and consecutive globular cluster
% disruption.

\todo[inline]{Paraphrase the following}
\citet{2019MNRAS.486.5838R}
``Out of the cluster formation models considered, the `no formation physics' model,
in which both the CFE and the ICMF are fixed throughout cosmic time, is
approximately equivalent to those studies  that  use  `particle-tagging'
techniques  to  identify  GCs  in cosmological simulations (e.g. Tonini 2013,
Renaud et al. 2017). We find that this cluster formation model continues to form GCs
at a vigorous rate until the present time, which implies it overproduces
the total GC mass in the Milky Way by a factor
5.5 relative to the mass formed in the fiducial model. Likewise, the continued
formation  of  GCs  in  this  model  predicts  the  on-going  formation
of massive (M $>10^5$ M\Sun) clusters with [Fe/H]$ <-0.5$ should be observed in
Milky Way-mass galaxies at $z=0$. For these reasons, an environmentally independent
cluster formation description is not compatible with observations.''



\section{Summary and conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We investigate GC candidates in the Auriga simulations and draw the following
conclusions.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The star formation model implemented in the Auriga simulations produces
    metallicity distributions that are more metal-rich the Milky Way and M31
    globular cluster systems.

    \item We reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ for any one of the Auriga simulations 
    that the GC candidates and the MW GCs are drawn from the same underlying 
    distribution with $\geq 98.68$~\% confidence. This statement holds true when
    we select all old star particles (GC candidates), but also when we select the 
    old accreted or the old insitu star particles. In addition, this is also
    the case when we test against the M31 GCS instead of the MW GCS.

    \item GC candidates in the Auriga simulations may be found out to $R_{200}$,
    given that our selection function of star particles selects all stars bound
    to the main subhalo in the main halo. The stellar mass is dominated by accreted 
    star particles at radii beyond $20$~kpc. The GCs in the MW and M31, on the 
    other hand, have a much smaller radial extend.

    \item The cluster formation efficiency would have to increase with decreasing
    metallicity for GC candidates in the Auriga simulations to be consistent
    with the Milky Way GC system, given that we expect dynamical evolution to 
    more strongly affect GC candidates at smaller radii. This trent of over-production
    of old star particles that are metal-rich and at large radii compared to 
    observed GCs is less clear for the M31 GCS.

    \item The Auriga simulations are not consistent with the picture that all
    metal-rich GCs formed insitu and that all metal-poor GCs were accreted.

\end{itemize}
