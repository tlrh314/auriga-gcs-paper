We investigate whether the galaxy and star formation model used for the Auriga simulations
can produce a realistic globular cluster (GC) population. We compare statistics of GC candidate
star particles in the Auriga haloes with catalogues of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda
(M31) GC populations. We find that the Auriga simulations do produce sufficient stellar mass
for GC candidates at radii and metallicities that are typical for the MW GC system (GCS).
We also find varying mass-ratios of the simulated GC candidates relative to the observed
mass in the MW and M31 GC systems for different bins of galactocentric radius-metallicity
(r$_{\text{gal}}$ -[Fe/H]). Overall, the Auriga simulations produce GC candidates with higher metallicities
than the MW and M31 GCS and they are found at larger radii than observed. The Auriga
simulations would require bound cluster formation efficiencies higher than ten percent for the
metal-poor GC candidates, and those within the Solar radius should experience negligible
destruction rates to be consistent with observations. GC candidates in the outer halo, on the
other hand, should either have low formation efficiencies, or experience high mass loss for the
Auriga simulations to produce a GCS that is consistent with that of the MW or M31. Finally,
the scatter in the metallicity as well as in the radial distribution between different Auriga runs
is considerably smaller than the differences between that of the MW and M31 GCSs. The
Auriga model is unlikely to give rise to a GCS that can be consistent with both galaxies.
